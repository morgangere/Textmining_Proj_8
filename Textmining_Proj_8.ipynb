       "\"Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. And the gentleman is correct, and we were sitting here listening to some of the Members that came before us talk about the importance of supply, and there's a couple of issues.    One is the fact that we are dealing with folks who are advocating increasing supply 10 and 20 years from now. The policies of drilling off the coasts and opening up new areas of the Outer Continental Shelf, opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, the first drop of oil does not come for 10 years. We don't achieve peak capacity in either of those areas for at least 20 years, according to the Department of Energy, President's Bush own Department of Energy. Those aren't our numbers; that's their numbers.    So the issue of increasing supply--and they have a really nice slogan that they like to use: Drill here, drill now. And we'll see them wearing their buttons, and you hear some of the radio talk show hosts around the country: Drill here, drill now. And that's a great slogan, but that's not what ANWR is. That's not what opening up new areas of the Outer Continental Shelf is. If you are advocating that policy, if that's your energy policy, then your slogan ought to be: Drill here, drill in 10 years, drill in 20 years. So that's one side of the equation.    But to what the gentleman talks about, if you're going to make the argument that the only way to solve this energy crisis is to increase the supply of oil, domestic supply, let's get more oil on to the market--and again, what they're advocating isn't doing it immediately--but if you're saying we need to do it immediately, well, there is one way to do it immediately, and let's take a look at the history.    The gentleman talked about, effective July 1, the 70,000 barrels a day every day that this country was placing into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is now going into the private market, effective July 1. What's been the impact? Well, on July 7, which was that first day after the July 4 holidays, the price of gas was at an all-time high. I believe it was four-eleven-and-a-half, highest it's ever been. We're right now about 6 cents less than that, not a substantial decrease. But instead of the exponential increase that we had seen for months, trajectory of price straight up, we've now seen a very slight decrease, but a decrease nonetheless. Certainly, some stability in the market where none existed before as a direct result of the action this Congress took to begin withholding shipments in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and now we've seen the impact. It has reduced the price.    Well, what do you think the impact would be instead of 70,000 barrels a day, how about taking 70 million barrels out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, over a certain period of time, not all at once, but putting 70 million barrels into the market? You would see an amazing decrease in the price, as the gentleman knows, and that's what we advocated here today.    And while we were sitting here listening to the Members that came before us, a couple of them in particular talked about how this Congress has done nothing advocating increasing supply. Well, today, not last week or last year, today before we came on the floor for this speech, this whole House took a vote a couple of hours ago on releasing 70 million barrels. You want to talk about now, that's now, 70 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, put it into the market.    It would have an incredible effect, not only on decreasing gas prices because you have more supply, but    maybe even more importantly, on these speculators who are betting on the price of oil continuing to go up and manipulating the price in the market, and that's a very real issue. It's a very big part of why gas prices have gone up as high as they have because of this market speculation. They wouldn't know how to react if we put 70 million barrels in a time sequence over time into the market. That would have real impact on their ability to continue to manipulate, and they would lower the cost in the market as well. It would have two impacts.    And how do those Members who talk about increasing supply and the need of this Congress to do something about gas prices--it's all they talk about. Well, what did they do? Well, most all of them voted against it. We have the numbers here on the vote. 157 Republicans opposed that vote today. 157 voted against increasing domestic supply of oil. After all the lectures we've had to endurefor the last several months about how we need to put more oil in the market, we had a vote to do just that today. A hundred plus of them voted against it. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. To put that in perspective to what we did today, half of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve would be approximately 350 million barrels. We voted today on 70 million barrels, time released over time. Speaker Gingrich recommended a much more drastic course of action, 350 million barrels, and again, 157 Republicans voted against a much smaller version of that today. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I'm sorry, if the gentleman will yield, because I hadn't seen this quote before we came on today, that quote--because people at home might say, well, when was that from? Was that from 1996? What are we talking about? That quote was from June 12 of this year. Last month is when that quote came from. So that's a real-time quote, talking about half the Strategic Petroleum Reserve as a course of action.     Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. And I appreciate the gentleman yielding.    And I would put it in the perspective of, let's take a look at how we got where we are today, take a little walk down memory lane. And why have gas prices gone up so dramatically? And the speakers on the other side will bring up their charts with their timelines and try to point fingers and cast blame.    The three major reasons that gas prices have increased so dramatically over the past several months is the increased demand for growing economies like China and India. There is nothing we can do about that; that is going to continue to grow, it's going to continue to be a problem. And we're going to have to continue to deal with that, the increased demand in growing economies.    However, two of the other main reasons why the price of gas has gone up so much over the past several months, the speculators in the market manipulating the price, driving it up beyond reasonable levels because they're betting that the cost of oil is going to continue to go up. That's something we can do something about, something we are going to do something about.    And the other factor, a major reason for the price of oil in the market having risen to all-time record highs--before we stopped the Strategic Petroleum Reserve shipments, which has led to the decrease in recent weeks, but it's still at a near record high for the price of oil--is the U.S. dollar and the low dollar around the world.    Oil is traded in the world market with the U.S. dollar. Obviously we use the U.S. dollar, so we're going to pay more for oil as a result of the deflation that has taken place with the dollar at near record lows in relation to other currencies around the world. Anyone who has traveled this summer to other countries can see the impact of the low dollar on your exchange rate.    Well, let's take a look at why that happened. Why do we have such a low dollar? Two of the main reasons:    Our trade deficit, the imbalance in trade from what we're shipping out overseas to what we're bringing in. We're bringing in a lot more from overseas than we're exporting. The trade imbalance plays a huge role in that.    And of course the debt, the national debt. And we've talked many times--I won't give you the long lecture on it. But suffice it to say 8 years ago we were looking at a $5.5 trillion surplus over the next 10 years, could have paid off the entire national debt. Because of the economic policies of this administration and the previous Congresses when they controlled both the White House and Congress on the other side, the decisions that were made have led to a skyrocketing national debt, deficits every year, deficits as far as the eye can see. And now, instead of having paid off the entire national debt, what do we have? We have a debt ceiling that's now over $10 trillion. That's why the dollar is at an all-time low. That's one of the big reasons why oil has skyrocketed in the world market.    So the very people who made those decisions, the very people who are responsible for those economic policies and those trade policies that have led to devaluation of the dollar in the world-wide market, the very same people who made those decisions are now coming forward with their ideas on what to do with regard to the energy crisis. And we should take that with a grain of salt, at minimum, because we've seen the impact of their policies, we know what happened. The American people have cast judgment on what they thought about those policies. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. And I would remind our colleagues and the gentleman--he probably was sitting here when President Bush stood right behind him at that podium in this House for his State of the Union Address--probably 2005, I think--and talked about our addiction to oil, spent most of his speech talking about our addiction to oil and how we need to do everything we can and have a national priority to get away from our addiction to oil. Well, his energy plan is inconsistent with that rhetoric because his energy plan is all about furthering our addiction to oil, cementing it---- Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. And we would be 7 years down the road of that initiative right now.    You think about the Apollo moon landing and the Manhattan Project, when Americans came together, worked towards a common goal, put our best and brightest and all of our resources on the task, and we got the job done. So we would be 7 years into that right now. We would have made such tremendous progress.    And it wouldn't have just been us, it would be the entire world. The people at Honda and Toyota are putting out hydrogen fuel cell cars and hybrid battery-operated cars. The hybrid car in the 2010 model for Toyota is going to get 90 miles for the gallon. And there are going to be kinks and they're going to be too expensive at first, but we're getting there, we're making progress. Imagine 7 years ago, if we had had a national and worldwide commitment led by the United States of America,  how different things would be today instead of paying $4 a gallon for gas. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. The gentleman is correct. We had an energy crisis 35 years ago where people had to wait in line for their gas, and depending on whether you had an even or odd number ending your license plate, you had to alternate days to even have the right to buy gas. And when that crisis subsided, this country, unfortunately, took a sigh of relief and said, well, I'm glad that's over. Let's keep doing it the way we're doing it, let's keep doing what we're doing. And we are not going to let that happen again.    We are not going to leave this for people like your niece, who was just born that you're talking about. We are going to address the problem now. We're going to take the steps, in a very long-term away, to be thoughtful, and take an approach that's not going to continue our addiction to oil, that's not going to continue our dependence on oil. We're going to move forward in a way that's going to move us away from oil and look at every possible source.    Mr. Pickens, who you have the chart behind you, the gentleman from Ohio, he has his ideas on how to do that. And I don't know if it's going to be windmills--which is what Mr. Pickens advocates. I don't know if it's going to be hydrogen fuel cell or hybrid cars or solar or nuclear or clean burning coal or something we haven't thought of, but let's put everyone we have, all of our resources, the best and brightest, on the job. Let's get it done.    And the mission should be to get us off of oil. That's where we want to go. That's something we didn't do 35 years ago and, unfortunately, we're the worse off for it. It's something we didn't do 7 years ago when we had a national crisis where we could have made that step in the right direction, we didn't do it. But we are here now, and we are not going to let the same mistakes be made this time that were made in the past. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I will tell you what else is irresponsible. The gentleman from Ohio has a chart behind him that has quotes from T. Boone Pickens about the oil industry and advocates of this ANWR and offshore drilling, ``Drill Here, Drill Now,'' and we have talked about that, and he says, ``They mislead the public.'' That's Mr. Pickens' quote. That's what's irresponsible. It's irresponsible to put forward a policy that is specifically designed to score political points; to, in a very cheap way, take advantage of the American people's exasperation with the fact that gas prices have skyrocketed out of control in recent months.    So instead of trying to solve the problem, instead of joining us in voting today to release 70 million barrels of oil into the market immediately, instead of joining us to force the oil companies to use the nearly 90 million acres that are already permitted and leased and ready to go and force them to drill on it right now or we're going to give that lease to somebody who will, instead of joining us in these efforts, they oppose it, and we have been unable to pass them out of the House because of their opposition, when we have almost unanimously on our side supported it. That's what is going on here, and that is why Mr. Pickens talks about the public being misled on this because when your slogan here is ``Drill Here, Drill Now'' and the only  policy that you're advocating for doesn't create the first drop of oil for at least 10 years, there's a disconnect there and you are misleading the public. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. And there may be some, Mr. Ryan, who are watching us today among our colleagues who would say, well, what are the facts? You're giving your set of facts and figures. How do I know that what you're saying is true?    I would encourage any of our colleagues who are watching this to go to the Department of Energy's Web site, pull up EIA, the Energy Information Administration, which is where all these figures that we talk about come from. That's President Bush's own Department of Energy that is telling us what numbers we're using today.    And when you hear us talk about the 68 million acres, we are talking about in the Continental United States, areas that are leased, ready to go. The oil companies have in an auction bought those leases. Clearly they think there's oil there. They are paying rent on those leases right now for the right to keep that land. They would not do that if they didn't think there is oil there. But our friends on the other side will still come one by one and parade up and say, well, there's no oil there. Those are dry holes and there's nothing there. They're wrong, but let's just let that go and say, okay, let's talk about the 20 million acres in Alaska that we also talk about where there's a similar, though not identical, circumstance where the Congress has approved the ability of the oil companies to lease and start drilling there. We're not standing in the way. We have opened it up. The oil companies can drill there. It's the Department of the Interior that has dragged their feet in getting these leases out. We want them to have the lease sales and the auctions to get the process going. It's closer to Prudhoe Bay than ANWR; so the pipeline construction wouldn't take as long, and it's estimated that we could pull oil out of this area in 3 to 4 years instead of the 10 years it would take to pull it out of ANWR, which is a little bit further away.    So what's the point of all this? The point of all this is our friends on the other side will say the same thing: There's no oil there. That's not the fruitful area. It's ANWR where the oil is, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.    Well, you might buy that argument except for fact what is the name of this territory that we're talking about in Alaska? The name of the 20 million acres that we are talking about is the National Petroleum Reserve. Now, it would seem to me that if the name of the area is the ``National Petroleum Reserve,'' there's probably some oil there. I think that's a pretty safe guess. So you would have a pretty hard time saying that's the reason why we're not pulling oil out of the ground, because it's not there, in the National Petroleum Reserve.    So we brought to the floor last week a bill that said the Department of Interior is directed to hold the lease auctions, to get the process going. The big oil companies are encouraged and, in fact, more than encouraged. They will either use the land for drilling or they will lose the right and we will give it to somebody who will. And we brought that bill to the floor. And as the gentleman knows, what happened? All those same people who stand over on the other side and lecture us about the need to increase domestic supply, ``Drill Here, Drill Now,'' they voted against it. Not all but most. The vast majority voted against it. Now, that seems pretty inconsistent to me.    So what's the motivation? Well, I'm not going to speculate on individual Members' motivation. But if your mantra, if your cause celebre is ``Drill Here, drill now, increase domestic production, let's get more oil on the market,'' and when the Congress brings to the floor a bill that does exactly that and sooner than the course of action that you advocate, I think you need to go home and explain to your constituents why you voted against that bill. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I thank the gentleman. That is something that we have worked on in this Congress and something that we have a great record of achievement is higher education. When you look at families struggling with the economy and look at the problems that we have with increased health care costs, certainly gas prices like we're talking about, the cost of higher education is right there with the struggles that most middle class families or many middle class families in this country are facing. And this Congress took, in the very early days, a step, a very big step, to help families.    We cut in half the interest rates on student loans from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent. And as the gentleman indicates, that by itself is going to save the average student borrower in this country $4,400 over the lifetime of the loan.    But we didn't stop just there. We increased Pell grants to their highest level in history, and we capped at 15 percent of income the amount of discretionary income that the borrower after they graduate will be required to pay, which will help them minimize their debt, prevent them from getting overextended with their debt obligations when they're not making a lot of money right from the start, and avoid some of the problems that we have seen in the credit market now where people's homes have been foreclosed because they got overextended.    Those are real accomplishments on real issues that matter to the American people and matter to American families, and that's something that we have to stand on when we talk about what this Congress has done proactively.    We're talking about gas prices, and something we didn't even mention, which is a major reform, hadn't been done in 30 years, we increased the average miles-per-gallon standards, the fuel efficiency standards, from 24 miles per gallon on average to 35 miles per gallon. The first time it had been raised for American-made cars or cars sold in America in 30-plus years. So that's another real accomplishment of this Congress.    And we could go on. The gentleman talks about the minimum wage and others. So we are taking steps to help American families and people struggling in this downturn economy. Mr. ALTMIRE. (PASS ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, economists say the most important thing Congress can do to stimulate our struggling economy is to act quickly, and that is exactly what this House is going to do today.    House leaders from both parties worked with the President to craft the bipartisan agreement that is before us. We came together, and by acting quickly, we are hoping that our actions spark our economy.    The package is going to provide some relief to middle-income families who have been left behind in many ways over the last 7 years. This bill gives 117 million Americans a tax rebate so they can begin to breathe a little easier when paying their bills in the coming months.    Equally important, this economic package also gives tax breaks to small businesses to help spur investment and job creation.    Mr. Speaker, economists said we need to act fast, and that is what we did. Let's get to work and pass this economic stimulus package today. Mr. ALTMIRE. (NEIGHBORHOOD STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I yield myself such time as I may consume.    Madam Chairman, I offer this amendment to the Neighborhood Stabilization Act to ensure that illegal immigrants are not eligible for the financial assistance we're providing today to individuals adversely affected by the housing crisis.    Section 214 of the Housing and Community Development Act governs the participation of noncitizens in certain HUD programs. It requires valid documentation from the beneficiary, verification of that documentation by the appropriate entity, and outlines who may and may not be eligible for financial assistance.    Under section 214, illegal immigrants are not eligible for financial assistance. Let me repeat that: Under section 214, illegal immigrants are not eligible for financial assistance. And my amendment makes certain that section 214 rules apply to the new programs authorized by the Neighborhood Stabilization Act that we are debating tonight.    With the housing crisis and economic downturn impacting the lives of hardworking Americans throughout the country, we need to make sure that targeted, fiscally responsible assistance that we are providing goes only to law-abiding citizens.    As responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars, it is our responsibility to ensure that every penny is spent wisely and is not used to benefit any illegal immigrants in any way.    I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment.    Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ALTMIRE. (NEIGHBORHOOD STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    The Acting CHAIRMAN. All time for debate on the amendment has expired.    The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Altmire).    The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. ALTMIRE. (TIME FOR A NEW DIRECTION ON ENERGY POLICY -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, while the consumers continue to pay record prices at the pump, the Big Oil companies are once again pocketing all-time record profits; yet they disavow any correlation to those high gas prices. But do they really expect the American people to believe that?    During the first six years of the Bush administration, Congress pursued policies that furthered our dependence on oil. They showered the Big Oil companies with billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies but never explained why those corporations deserve corporate welfare.    Since regaining control of Congress, Democrats have twice passed legislation to redirect every penny of those taxpayer subsidies into research and development on alternative sources of fuel.    For years, Republicans in Washington have supported a policy of corporate welfare for Big Oil that clearly hasn't worked. It's time for a new direction on energy policy. Mr. ALTMIRE. (HONORING THE LIFE OF GEORGE BECKER -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Madam Speaker, as we take a very important vote for organized labor today, I rise to honor the life of George Becker, who passed away last month.    George served as president of the United Steelworkers of America from 1993 to 2001. He started working in a mill in 1944 at the age of 15. He fought in World War II and Korea.    After fighting for his country abroad, he spent over 50 years fighting for working Americans here at home. As president of the Steelworkers, George Becker fought tirelessly for workplace safety, for workers' rights and for fair trade practices.    I wish to express my sincere condolences to George Becker's wife, Jane, my constituent and my friend. Jane shared life with George for 57 years. George Becker will be deeply missed, but his selfless devotion to America's workers will always be remembered. Mr. ALTMIRE. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, there has been a lot of conversation about how this is a Federal Government program and how this is a move to expand Government's role in health care, so I thought I would take a moment, a minute, to talk about what is really in this bill.    This is an expansion of an existing program created 10 years ago in a Republican Congress. It is a capped block grant. The amount of money is capped. It flows through the States, and almost every State in the country administers the program through the private health insurance market. Through the private market.    This could not be anything further from a big, government-run program. It is administered by the States and contracted out to the private market.    And yes, these are families that have income. They are families that work hard and play by the rules, and they are families that can't afford health care for their children. Is there any better cause in this country that we can work on in this Congress than that issue? I ask my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I appreciate the gentleman from Ohio.    I do hope those who are interested in this topic--and everybody in this country, I think, is interested in the issue of gas prices and is certainly interested in alternative sources of energy--have heard what the gentleman has just said.    There was a poll taken which somebody talked to me about today. Fifty-four percent of the American people think that we should drill for more oil domestically. Well, I don't think there is anybody in this Congress who disagrees with that statement. What does that mean?    As the gentleman said, there are 68 million acres. That is not a typographical error. I'm not misspeaking. The gentleman was not misspeaking. There are 68 million acres of Federal lands that are currently available and permitted to drill for oil. Well, why aren't the oil companies drilling for oil there? There are a variety of reasons.    Some of it is the construction. The permitting, the geological, the surveying work that needs to be done takes a long time. That's the issue with ANWR, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. If we said today we were going to allow the oil companies to drill for oil in ANWR, it would be 10 years before the first drop of oil came, and it would be 20 years before ANWR was at peak capacity. I'll return to that momentarily.    Part of that 68 million acres that isn't being utilized is going to be developed at some point, but they're not there yet. Part of it is that the oil companies buy up these leases and stockpile them because that looks good on their assets, and they file their financial reports, and it helps their bottom line because they hold the futures on stockpiled assets that are leased acreage for oil drilling. But we have in the Outer Continental Shelf already identified where 80 percent of the known oil is. It is within the area where the oil companies are already permitted to drill and where 8,000 leases already exist. So 80 percent of the known oil in the Outer Continental Shelf is already within an area in which we're able to drill for more oil.    So those watching tonight might say, ``Well, how much of that 80 percent are we drilling on?'' Well, we're drilling on about a quarter of it. About 75 percent of the leases that are held in that area where we know that there is oil is not being used for oil drilling right now. It's the same situation. Some of it is being surveyed, and the geological work is being done, and they're going to do some construction, and they'll get there. Some of it is just being held by the oil companies.    Then you have the coast of Florida, where the gentlewoman is from, and you have the coast of California, and you're getting into those issues. It's the same thing. We have identified places in this country where it's already available to drill for oil.    You might say, ``All right. What are we talking about? How much oil are we talking about?'' How about 4.2 million barrels of oil per day that we could get from those 68 million acres if we were drilling right now where the leases are already held. 4.2 million barrels.    By comparison is ANWR, which we're talking about. The first drop of oil arrives in the pipeline in ANWR 10 years from the time that we say you're allowed to drill there. 40,000 barrels of oil per day that first year from ANWR. 40,000 barrels per day. Currently, the worldwide oil market is about 80 million barrels per day. So we're talking infinitesimal on the worldwide market.    When ANWR is at peak capacity, according to the experts, it's going to be approximately 800,000 barrels a day. It's going to be 800,000 barrels of oil a day in a market that's 80 million barrels a day, a worldwide market. Let's think about that 4.2 million barrels that we could get from the 68 million acres, and I know we're talking about a lot of numbers right now. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. The point is this: We already know where there is oil to drill in this country. The oil companies already own the leases where they could drill for that oil. They're making a conscious decision, for a variety of reasons, not to drill for oil in places where they're already permitted to do so.    Lastly, on refineries, people will say, ``Well, let's build more refineries.'' Well, we have half the number of refineries today that we had 30 years ago because the companies have shut them down, and the refineries that we do still have are operating, as the gentleman said, at 85    percent capacity.    So what is the point of spending the time and the effort to build more refineries, and what is the point of spending the money if the refineries that we have aren't even operating at near full capacity? There are other ways we could spend our time. There are other ways we could spend our resources. There are other ways we could spend our money.    So what, I think, every Member of our side of the aisle agrees on is we have a crisis regarding gas prices in this country right now. I don't think anybody would disagree with that. We're paying over $4 a gallon. It's  going to continue to go up in the foreseeable future. We have to make a decision. We've arrived at a crisis point. We have a decision to make. There are no short-term solutions.    Now, we can put a Band-Aid on it and do the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which we did, which is going to have some impact. It's not a long-term solution. We're going to talk about manipulation in the market and about the speculation that goes on, and that drives the price per barrel up. We can do some short-term things there, but in the long term, we have to make a decision.    There are one of two ways we can go. We could either continue our dependence on oil--and yes, we're talking about domestic sources of oil when we talk about ANWR and the Outer Continental Shelf and the coasts of Florida and California. That's domestic oil. But there is not nearly enough oil there to produce that would bring down the percentage that we get from foreign nations. So, even if we were done and if we were pumping all of the oil from those 68 million acres and from the new land in ANWR and from the other locations, we still would get more oil from foreign nations than we would produce in this country. There's no way to get around that.    So the question is: If it's a 20-year process until we get to peak capacity at ANWR and in the Outer Continental Shelf, isn't there a better way that we could spend the next 20 years if we're going to pour money into it and have a national commitment to say we're going to find an alternative source of energy?    What I advocate and what I'm sure my colleagues would agree with is we need to put our best and brightest on the job and give them all of the resources that they need. We need to take everybody from our eighth grade science students on up to our Nobel Prize winners and say, figuratively, ``You go in the same room. We're going to give you all of the money that you need, all of the resources and all of the support this Nation can provide. This is our number 1 priority. Figure out a way to make a car run affordably on something other than gasoline.''    We can do that, but we can't do both because every dollar we spend drilling for more oil or that we spend building more refineries is a dollar we could have spent getting us off oil and getting us off our dependence on foreign oil. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I think it is instructive, the gentleman talks about mistakes having been made on other issues. It is instructive when you think about the people who are making the arguments for how to solve the problems that we face today, let's take a look at what the track record is and how we got to where we are today. Who made the decisions that have led us to where we are today?    I know I don't want to be partisan about this, but the facts are the facts. There are three reasons that gas prices have gone up, two of which we can control and one we can't. We can't control the increased demand in China and India and other countries in the world. It is a huge driving force. It is going to continue to get worse over time. It is going to continue to drive an increase.    The other two factors, increased speculation in the market and manipulation of the price in the worldwide oil market. The gentlewoman from Florida talks about what this Congress is doing on that issue in regulating that market and moving towards a more fair system that is going to decrease the price per barrel upwards of $30. We are taking action. That is a second cause.    But perhaps the biggest cause is the weak U.S. dollar. So let's take a look at why the dollar is so weak. Oil is traded in the worldwide market based on the dollar. We are paying more in this country. Obviously our currency is the U.S. dollar and we are paying more because of the weakness of the dollar which is at an all-time low, an historic low.    Well, it is because of the economic policies of the past 8 years that have driven our economy and driven the price of the dollar nearly to the ground. And I would invite anyone to compare where the dollar was based on other worldwide currencies 8 years ago versus today.    We have an enormous trade deficit which the gentleman and I deal with every day in our districts with the jobs that have been lost, and the trade deficit is at almost historic proportions. That has led to a decrease in the dollar.    But mostly the runaway spending of this Congress and the $3.5 trillion in debt that this administration and the previous three Congresses rolled up on the American people have led to the economic conditions that drove the price of the dollar down, that have resulted in sky-high gas prices.    So the exact same people who made the decisions that led to the crisis that we are in today now have their own recommended solutions. And I don't dispute their motives. I think they are in it for the same reason we are. They want to do the right thing. I just think they are wrong. I think that their course of action that they propose is not going to solve the problem, and in fact is going to lead to a worsening of the problem by furthering our dependence on oil, as we talked about. Mr. ALTMIRE. (RECOGNIZING 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF LAKE SIDNEY LANIER, GEORGIA -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 354) to recognize the year 2007 as the official 50th anniversary celebration of the beginnings of marinas, power production, recreation, and boating on Lake Sidney Lanier, Georgia.    The Clerk read the title of the resolution. Mr. ALTMIRE. (RECOGNIZING 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF LAKE SIDNEY LANIER, GEORGIA -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.    I rise in support of House Resolution 354 offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Deal) to recognize the year 2007 as the official 50th anniversary celebration of Lake Sidney Lanier.    Congress first authorized the construction of Buford Dam in 1946 as one project in a comprehensive plan to develop our Nation's water resources for the purposes of national defense, power production, flood control, navigation, and water supply. The first groundbreaking for construction occurred on March 1, 1950, and on June 17, 1957, the first hydropower was produced by the generators of the dam.     Today, Lake Lanier provides power production, flood control, water supply, navigation, fish and wildlife management, and recreational activities to members of the surrounding communities and businesses. This week in June is a suitable time to recognize Lake Lanier's contributions to the area and accomplishments. As summer heat begins to spread across the Nation, both water supply and cooling water recreational activities are on many minds.    More than 60 percent of the population of the State of Georgia relies on water stored in Lake Lanier or down the Chattahoochee River. Similarly, properties around the lake and down the river rely on its banks and dam for flood control.    Nearly 8 million visitors come annually to appreciate the scenery and leisure opportunities provided by the lake. In fact, Lake Lanier holds the title of the most-visited Army Corps lake in the entire country. Facilities include 10 marinas and 57 parks for swimming, boating, fishing and picnicking. In 1996, Lake Lanier hosted the paddling and rowing competitions for the Summer Olympics in Atlanta.    And several years ago, the Marine Trade Association of Metro Atlanta found that Lake Lanier has an economic impact of $5.5 billion.    I urge my colleagues to join with me and the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Deal) in supporting House Resolution 354 to honor the impacts, accomplishments and continuing success of Lake Lanier on its 50th anniversary.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ALTMIRE. (LIHEAP FUNDING -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of fully funding the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, known as LIHEAP. With energy prices at record levels, it is critical that Congress provides adequate LIHEAP funding to protect low-income seniors and families from the bitter cold in the winter and the extreme heat in the summer.    Because of rising energy prices and limited LIHEAP funding, 62,000 Pennsylvania households that were supposed to receive funding this year did not. Many of the families across the country who were not able to obtain LIHEAP funds will be forced to decide between paying their energy bill or purchasing other necessities like food or medicine. This is a decision that no hardworking family should have to make.    Madam Speaker, LIHEAP provides millions of low-income Americans with some relief from ever rising energy prices, but there are millions more that could use the help. I urge all of my colleagues to fully support funding for LIHEAP. Mr. ALTMIRE. (PROVIDING FOR CONCURRENCE BY HOUSE WITH AMENDMENT IN SENATE AMENDMENT TO H.R. 4253, MILITARY RESERVIST AND VETERAN SMALL BUSINESS REAUTHORIZATION AND OPPORTUNITY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Madam Speaker, last month the House and the Senate passed the Military Reservist and Veterans Small Business Reauthorization and Opportunity Act to expand business opportunities for veterans and Reservists. And after Senate action, today we will vote again to pass this legislation that I introduced to ensure veterans and Reservists are afforded every opportunity for economic success at home given their sacrifices abroad.    Starting and maintaining a small business can be challenging for anyone, and unfortunately veterans often face unique obstacles as a result of their military service. The unemployment rate among veterans is more than twice that of the national average, and nearly 40 percent of Reservists lose income when they are deployed.    While Congress has taken action to provide Federal agencies with resources to encourage entrepreneurial opportunities for veterans, I believe that more can still be done to relieve the burden that is placed on small business owners during and after deployment.    At a time when our veteran population continues to grow, it is more important than ever for us to afford our brave men and women in uniform every opportunity for success. The Military Reservist and Veterans Small Business Reauthorization and Opportunity Act provides the SBA's Office of Veterans Business Development with the resources necessary to expand entrepreneurial opportunities for veterans and Reservists and improve existing programs to help keep small businesses afloat while their members are deployed.    The amendment we will consider today makes minor changes to the bill we passed in December, but the intent remains the same. This legislation increases funding for the SBA's Office of Veterans Business Development, improves programs designed to help relieve the burden placed on small business owners during and after deployments, facilitates the coordination of all Federal agencies to focus attention on expanding opportunities for veteran-owned businesses, makes the SBA Advisory Committee on Veterans Business Affairs permanent, and increases the number of veterans business outreach centers across the country.    Madam Speaker, there is no question that veterans have a unique ability to thrive as entrepreneurs. They have the skill and the drive necessary to run successful businesses. But more must be done to help them fulfill their goals and their needs.    I strongly support this legislation, which I introduced, and I ask my colleagues for their support of the Military Reservist and Veterans Small Business Reauthorization and Opportunity Act, and urge the Senate to quickly take up and pass this important legislation.        Lastly, Madam Speaker, I would thank the gentleman from Florida, my good friend, Mr. Buchanan; the ranking member, Mr. Chabot, for their help in working through these issues. And hopefully now, with the work of the chairwoman, we can have a bill that can pass both Chambers and move to the President's desk. Mr. ALTMIRE. (DEMOCRATS RECOGNIZE THAT ECONOMY IS IN TROUBLE AND VOW TO WORK WITH PRESIDENT TO STIMULATE IT -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Madam Speaker, as Congress resumes this week, our priority must be to work in a bipartisan fashion to address our struggling economy.    There is no way to sugarcoat this economy. Over the past 12 months, wages have fallen, forcing hardworking middle-class families to work harder for less. As a result, family debt is at an all-time high and household debt averages an average 133 percent of disposable income. Last year, families were spending 14.5 percent of their disposable income to service their own debt, and middle-class families are having a harder and harder time just making ends meet.    Democrats want to work with President Bush to create a bipartisan economic plan that is timely, targeted, and temporary. Economic experts say this is the best way to stimulate the economy. Last Friday, congressional leaders sent a letter to President Bush asking him to come to the table so that a bipartisan plan can be reached.    Madam Speaker, the American people need our help during this uncertain economic time. We cannot wait any longer to help this economy, and the only way it can be done is if we work together. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - June 06, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I just want to say how proud I am of my fellow Pennsylvanian and the second Murphy now to join the 30-Something Working Group, along with the gentleman from Connecticut. He is someone that we look to for his expertise, having been in the field of battle and having served in this conflict; and I really am excited to hear that he is going to be joining us now with the 30-something group to talk more about these issues. And he definitely has a unique perspective that he's adding. So I was excited to hear his voice, and I am very proud to hail from the same State.    I wanted to talk a little bit about one of the consequences of this action that we're talking about, as Mr. Meek brought up, is the fact that we are creating, through our actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, hundreds of thousands of new veterans are returning to this country, many of whom are returning seriously injured. We have over 25,000 that have been injured. We are approaching 4,000 killed now. And those  that are returning and are going to have to use the VA system are going to find, thankfully, that for the first time in the history of the program, 77 years of the Department of Veterans Affairs, we have increased funding at a rate that has never been seen in the history of the Department. We are up to approximately $15 billion in increased funding for the VA in this Congress.    And as every member of the 30-Something Working Group knows and certainly every Member of this House knows, this is a priority issue for me. Funding for Veterans Affairs has languished in the past several years, unfortunately, but this Congress has stepped up to the plate in a bipartisan way, I will say, to give the Veterans Affairs Department, especially the health accounts, the necessary funding to take care of these hundreds of thousands of veterans that we are creating in Iraq and Afghanistan.    These are men and women who have fought bravely, people like Mr. Murphy from Pennsylvania who have put their lives on the line, who have left a family behind to do this and have made every possible sacrifice. They deserve to know that they can count on the United States to give them the health care that they deserve and that they have earned, that they've been promised when they entered the military.    So we voted in just the first 5 months here in this Congress to increase funding by $15 billion for the VA. And significantly, for the first time ever, we exceeded the recommended independent budget request of the service organizations, the American Legion, the VFW, and others.    I want to repeat that point for my colleagues. For the first time ever, Congress exceeded the request of the service organizations. I think that's something we can be proud of.    We talk about the enormous achievements we've had in the first 5 months, the many bills and the different subjects that we have addressed. The fact that we have paid attention to and finally moved forward with our veterans health care facility in a way that is unprecedented in the history of this country is I think one of the things we can be most proud of in our first 5 months in office here.    Some of the things that this funding is going to allow us to do, we are going to be able to hire more doctors and nurses and improve medical services at the VA. As we saw with some of the Department of Defense facilities with regard to health care and Walter Reed, chronic underfunding can lead to some disastrous consequences. We need to make sure that we don't allow that to happen in our VA system. So this bill is going to improve the quality of care.    I have in my district a Department of Veterans Affairs hospital that is undergoing a $100 plus million expansion right now. Hopefully, when that is done, we are going to have in my district the preeminent health care facility in the entire VA network; and I want every VA facility to have that type of access across this country. Our veterans deserve nothing less than the highest quality health care this Nation can provide for them.    We are going to reduce waiting times. We have a backlog at the VA, unfortunately, of nearly 500,000 cases. And every Member of this House knows, you probably have the same experience that I am having in my office of people who are calling, frustrated veterans who want to access the VA health system but they have to wait, they have to get in line. And it is a very long line, weeks or months of waiting, because of that backlog, nearly 500,000 cases. The bill that we passed in this House, the legislation that we've passed is going to go a long way towards improving that situation. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - June 06, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I appreciate the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Meek) for his comments and certainly his leadership on this issue, which is unmatched in this House. I am proud to hear your comments.    We have a situation at Walter Reed which we all came to know very well, of course, in the months. I had the opportunity to tour Walter Reed, and when you see these kids that are returning from battle and you think about them, one of the fantastic gentlemen that we met was a 2005 graduate of the Naval Academy. And you can picture him just 2 short years ago in his uniform, throwing his hat in the air, excited, cream of the crop, the best this Nation can put forward, and he came home just horrifically injured.    It breaks your heart to see these men and women who fought so bravely, and you think that they went home to Walter Reed, and it is our responsibility to give them the best medical care that money can provide, and we had disastrous things happening there. You think of the living conditions that were outlined in that Washington Post article, and the paint peeling from the walls and the rodents and the mold, and you think, how could we possibly have let this happen?    For several years, there were complaints that were made, but nothing was done about it. But this Congress is doing something about it. We have not only done the investigations and the oversight to find out what went wrong and to hold those accountable who are responsible for what happened at Walter Reed, but, just as important, we have a commitment in this House and in this Congress that this is never going to happen again.    We are going to give the necessary funding to the Department of Defense and to Walter Reed so that they can take care of the maintenance and the repair that's necessary. And we are going to do a top-to-bottom review of every Department of Defense health facility and every VA facility in this country, find out if anything similar is happening, if there are any problems of this sort, and fix them immediately, not wait for this to take place again.    Because it shouldn't take a Washington Post article. It shouldn't take the newspaper to bring this situation to light. We have a responsibility, and we are fulfilling that responsibility, to ensure that this never happens again. And we are doing that in a variety of ways, through oversight and through the funding increases that I've talked about.    The supplemental bill that we supported and that went to the President's desk, which was signed, included an increase in funding to help the Department of Defense health care and the VA health facilities fulfill these obligations. And, as I said, we are now at record levels. The Appropriations Committee dealing with Veterans Affairs just today announced that they had marked up their bill with a $6.7 billion  increase in funding for the VA which, as I said, for this 1 year is the largest in history and is nearly $4 billion above what the President had requested.    We are going to talk a little bit later about bipartisanship, and that is an issue of which there can be no disagreement. There are issues that we talk about, like immigration, like Iraq, like tax cuts, where there is a deep divide among us. There are serious policy differences among us. But every Member of this House can agree that there is no group that should stand ahead of our Nation's veterans when it comes time to make Federal funding decisions. That is an issue that we can all agree on.    I am proud to be a Member of this House that has, for the first time in a very long time, as I said, created an atmosphere where we all agree that veterans come first, and we need to increase the level of funding for the VA health facilities after years and years of neglect.    So, with that said, I would yield at this time to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Murphy). Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - June 06, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I wanted to commend the gentleman from Connecticut again. We say a lot of things when we are transferring comments here back and forth about the different roles that we play, but it truly is the truth to say there is no one in this Congress who has done more on a public policy basis to promote this issue than the gentleman from Connecticut. He has done it at the State level. He is passionate about it. He has done it here in Congress. He has made it a staple issue of his young career, and I want to commend him. He has shown great leadership.    And in saying that, I want to recognize that we have a colleague, the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DeGette), who certainly deserves credit second to none for her pushing this agenda. I certainly don't want to overlook her in recognizing Mr. Murphy's equal efforts on this issue.    I have a unique perspective in my support of this issue in that I am a pro-life Member of Congress. I used the occasion of my first floor speech on the floor of this House specifically on this issue because it is that important to me.    I have a view that embryonic stem cell research and a vote to promote it is a pro-life vote. By voting to pursue embryonic stem cell research, we are voting to improve the lives of people. And most importantly with this bill, we are voting only on, and this is a very key point, lines of stem cells that would otherwise be discarded by the fertility clinic. That cannot be overlooked. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - June 06, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. This is not a situation where we are going to be able to pick and choose types of stem cells that can be used for other purposes. The administration talks about snowflake babies and other uses. These are only lines of stem cells where the donor has said I am done using them. They cannot be used for my other purpose, they are to be discarded, and then they agree that the stem cells could be used for research purposes. Otherwise they are discarded.    That is something that in my mind is the decisive point on this. If they are going to be discarded anyway, hundreds of thousands of lines of embryonic stem cells, why not use them for scientific research to save the lives and improve the lives of people who are alive today, real men and women who are suffering from diseases, and the people who don't know they are going to have those diseases in the future, people who are going to suffer from these diseases tomorrow.    We are talking about debilitating diseases, we are talking about long-term diseases that are reaching epidemic proportions in my district of southwestern Pennsylvania, like diabetes. Imagine if this research could show a cure or improved treatment for any of these illnesses. Why would we not use them for scientific purposes if they are otherwise going to be discarded.    I am certainly not the only pro-life Member who is going to support this tomorrow, as the gentleman said. But I do want to emphasize this is an issue whose time has come. The President has vetoed it in the 109th Congress. He has vetoed it once in this 110th Congress. We are expecting we are going to face a second veto, and I know the vote is going to be close on whether or not we are going to be able to override that veto.    But we have sent a message, and we are going to do it tomorrow, that the time for this issue has come. This is not about political games or trying to score points for a political agenda. This is about saving lives and improving the lives of people who are alive today, and I strongly support this initiative. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - June 06, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I will do two things. First, it has come to my attention that while we were talking the Anaheim Ducks kept the Stanley Cup in the United States of America. I want to congratulate them. And I will now yield back to the gentleman from Florida to wrap up. Mr. ALTMIRE. (MICHAEL A. MARZANO DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS OUTPATIENT CLINIC -- (House of Representatives - September 15, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I thank the chairman.    This legislation designates the Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic at Hermitage, Pennsylvania, as the Michael A. Marzano Department of Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic. I was pleased to join with my friend and colleague, Congressman PHIL ENGLISH, last year in introducing this legislation, which will pay tribute to the service and sacrifice of a true Western Pennsylvania hero, Marine Corps Sergeant Michael Marzano.    A native of Greenville, Pennsylvania, Michael Marzano grew up with the dream of becoming a marine. Upon graduating from Sharon High School, Marzano applied to the U.S. Marine Corps and was initially denied entry because of a knee injury he suffered his senior year in high school. Determined to fulfill his dream, Marzano underwent surgery to correct the condition and continued to reapply to the U.S. Marine Corps until he was finally accepted 4 years later in 1999.    In December 2004, now Sergeant Marzano reiterated his commitment to the Nation by volunteering for a tour of duty in Iraq. But tragically, on May 8, 2005, after serving only 2 months in Iraq, the 28-year-old Sergeant Michael Marzano was killed by a suicide bomber while taking part in an offensive against insurgents in the city of Haditha, al Anbar province, in Iraq. He was the first soldier from Mercer County, Pennsylvania, to give his life in Operation Iraqi Freedom.    Following the incident, which also claimed the lives of three other brave American serv\\x1cice\\x1cmem\\x1cbers, Sergeant Marzano's commanding officer recalled Sergeant Marzano's leadership and bravery, stating, ``Many more lives were saved due to their sacrifice.''    Mr. Speaker, Michael Marzano is a true American hero and was a very special individual. By renaming this outpatient clinic, we will honor Sergeant Marzano's memory and recognize his bravery and sacrifice. Sergeant Marzano is representative of all those who have worn the uniform proudly, upheld the military's tradition of courage and faithful service, and once stood ready, if duty required, to make the ultimate sacrifice.    I thank Chairman Filner for his willingness to bring this bill to the floor, and I especially thank my friend and colleague Congressman English for his leadership in introducing this legislation. Mr. ALTMIRE. (100-HOUR AGENDA IS A GREAT SUCCESS -- (House of Representatives - January 19, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, during the Democrats' 100-hour agenda, the House overwhelmingly passed six bills that are going to make a real impact on the lives of everyday Americans. We have done what we said we are going to do and what the American people wanted to us do, and most important, we did it in a strong bipartisan fashion.    Sixty-eight Republicans joined us in implementing the 9/11 Commission recommendations; 82 Republicans joined us in raising the minimum wage for the first time in 10 years; and 124 Republicans joined us in cutting in half the interest rates on student loans. These bills received strong bipartisan support because they are important to the American people.    Mr. Speaker, I am hopeful that as we move forward we can continue to move legislation that can garner the support of both Republicans and Democrats in this House so that we can continue to make the lives of the American people better. Mr. ALTMIRE. (NATIONAL LANDSCAPE CONSERVATION SYSTEM ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 09, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.    I rise today to offer an amendment to the National Landscape Conservation System Act. Created in 2000, this act provides protective and restorative services to nearly 27 million acres of public lands, including a number of our Nation's most spectacular wilderness and scenic rivers.        The legislation before us today would codify this existing land preservation system, thus ensuring its existence for generations to come. However, as written, this bill does not protect the rights of our Nation's sportsmen, specifically, their continued right to hunt and fish on these lands.    Because I strongly support this right and want to make it absolutely clear that it is never infringed upon, my amendments states that enactment of this legislation will not, in any way, limit access for hunting, fishing, trapping or recreational shooting on the National Landscape Conservation System.    Furthermore, my amendment confirms that the right to manage, control and regulate hunting, fishing and trapping on these lands rests with the States, not with the Federal Government.    My amendment has garnered the enthusiastic support of a number of sportsmen's groups, including the National Rifle Association and Trout Unlimited. It is critically important that we ensure hunting and fishing activities remain a part of our Nation's heritage, so I ask my colleagues to support this amendment.    I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ALTMIRE. (M<em>c</em>CAIN'S ASSESSMENT OF ECONOMY SHOWS HE REALLY IS NOT AN EXPERT ON THE ECONOMY -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Madam Speaker, with all of the economic troubles on both Wall Street and Main Street, it's hard to believe that there are still people out there who think everything is going all right.     On Monday, the stock market fell 500 points, the biggest fall since the terror attacks of September 11. Lehman Brothers, one of the world's oldest financial institutions, filed for bankruptcy while another financial giant, Merrill Lynch, was bailed out of trouble by Bank of America. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said this was part of a once-in-a-century crisis.    I wish President Bush and Senator McCain felt that way. Stubbornly clinging to the belief that his economic policies are succeeding, President Bush described the events Monday as merely an adjustment. Senator McCain declared, once again, that the fundamentals of our economy are strong.    Well, Madam Speaker, President Bush and Senator McCain have to be two of the only people in the country who think the economy is just fine. How can they fix the crisis when they don't even realize it exists? Mr. ALTMIRE. (HEALTH CARE -- (House of Representatives - January 30, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I thank the gentleman, and I would address the Chair. We have a situation in this country as was just outlined where we have 47 million Americans with no health insurance at all. We have tens of millions more that live in fear of losing their coverage. Employers often are unable to offer insurance to their employees. This is an epidemic in this country, and I heard about it back in the district this past weekend, I hear about it everywhere I go, because health insurance is an issue that affects everybody. It doesn't matter if you are rich or poor, live in an urban setting, rural area. No matter where you are from, health care affects you directly. And, unfortunately, for the past 6 years this issue has been ignored. And truth be told, it has been ignored for longer than that. And we need to look at this issue because this is affecting our economy.    At General Motors, $1,500 of the price of producing a car is because of their health benefits. We can't compete with the rest of the world when other countries have health insurance provided. So we are starting $1,500 in the hole.    So I do commend President Bush for including health care as one of his top priorities in the State of the Union address. It is something that is long overdue, and I am happy that he has finally decided to look seriously at this issue. Unfortunately, the plan that he has proposed is not going to be more than a drop in the bucket to solving that problem.    We have a President who has now proposed a solution based on changes in the Tax Code to solve a problem that I have outlined. We spend $2 trillion a year as a Nation on health care, so he has recommended that he in some cases actually raise the costs to people's out-of-pocket expenses by taxing health care benefits for people. And I want to tell you something, if you don't have enough money to buy health insurance right now, you are one of the 58 million families that don't have any taxable income now because you are not making enough money to pay taxes, a tax deduction is not going to help you afford health insurance. And under the President's most optimistic estimations, his plan only offers health insurance to 3 million of the 47 million Americans that currently lack health insurance. So there may be a role for a Tax Code solution to the health crisis that we are facing in this country, but it is a very small part of what is happening.    I am glad that the doctor from Wisconsin has joined us, and I am sure he will have a lot to say. Mr. ALTMIRE. (HEALTH CARE -- (House of Representatives - January 30, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I thank the gentleman. And what this does is provide an incentive for younger and healthier workers to purchase insurance outside of the employer's plan because those benefits will be taxed, leaving only the older and sicker workers in the employer's risk pool, which is going to raise costs not only for us as individuals but for employers. And that is the last thing we need to be doing. That is going in exactly the wrong direction, because ultimately the employer's insurance is going to become unaffordable as it is left with nothing but sicker people in the risk pool.    And we need a more efficient system where we encourage people who are younger and healthier to participate in the same risk pools as everybody else, because right now if you are a small employer especially and one of your employees get sick, you get a phone call from the insurance company that says, You have two choices: we are either going to quadruple your premiums, or we are going to drop you entirely. And this plan that the President has proposed exacerbates that problem. It makes it worse, because now your benefits are taxed on top of having your premiums quadrupled. Mr. ALTMIRE. (HEALTH CARE -- (House of Representatives - January 30, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. And it is going to flood the insurance market with people who can't afford health insurance because of health problems.        Now if you are young and healthy and wealthy, that is a great plan. That sounds fine. Go out in the insurance market and buy a high-deductible, catastrophic plan, and you will be fine.    But for most American families in this country, we are going to see our insurance costs increase. Even if we are not participating in any of the new plans and nothing changes for us, our  costs are going to go up because folks who are younger and healthy are now outside the system, and we are in the same insurance pool with everybody else. Mr. ALTMIRE. (HEALTH CARE -- (House of Representatives - January 30, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. I did want to talk about some of the out-of-pocket costs that individuals and families are going to be facing with this plan.    I did want to say how happy I am to see the gentlewoman from Florida, a very distinguished graduate from the Florida State University School of Law, here to join us tonight. I was excited to hear your remarks as well.    Something that has not been talked about but I want Members to think about this when they go home and talk to especially their seniors, but also folks who maybe are just starting in the workforce and have years, maybe decades left ahead of them to pay into the Social Security system and look forward to their Social Security benefits, I want those Members to talk to their constituents about the fact that this plan, as proposed by the President, does the tax deduction up to $15,000 of taxable income.    So what that does, as we have talked about it, is it taxes your health care benefits above that level, but more importantly, from the perspective of Social Security, it reduces your income subject to the calculation of Social Security year after year after year, compounding itself, and that is going to reduce the Social Security benefits, your monthly check, for millions of Americans. That is something that is not even being discussed in this debate.    We all know the out-of-pocket costs on our health care, and I am going to talk about that in a moment, but I want folks who have years ahead of them to pay into the Social Security system to think what that would do to have $15,000 removed from your calculatable income for the purposes of determining your Social Security benefits. That is a direct hit on working-class Americans.    I also want folks to think about the fact that that $15,000 is going to be subject to a cost-of-living-type adjustment, inflation adjustment each year, but the cost of health care rises often three and four times greater annually than the cost of living in this country. So if you are a younger worker paying into this system year after year, you are going to lose money year after year after year in inflation-adjusted dollars because it is adjusted on the $15,000 based on the cost of living, not the actual cost of increases in the health care. That is a real hit to working Americans and working families in this country.    Lastly, I spoke earlier about the fact that this provides an incentive to younger and healthier workers to opt-out of this system and maybe opt for catastrophic, high-deductible plans, hoping that they will not get sick. What young families do not realize, the exact people that I am talking about is often in almost every case, maternity care is not covered under those types of plans. So for those Members who want to go back and talk to some of their young families in their district, I would ask them to consider how expensive that would be if they had to pay out of pocket for the costs of their maternity care.    I know Dr. Kagen could certainly comment on what those costs would be. We are talking about a real hit to working-class Americans. This does not benefit the majority of Americans, and, in fact, this makes the cost of health care more unaffordable for individuals. It raises costs on small businesses, employers, and it especially  hurts the self-employed because it removes the current deduction on health care for our self-employed.    So, again, the President has moved us in exactly the wrong direction that we need to be going. Mr. ALTMIRE. (HEALTH CARE -- (House of Representatives - January 30, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I wanted to comment on what the gentleman from Wisconsin was discussing with regard to community rating, which means there are approximately 160 million people in this country that are privately insured, get their insurance through their employer, pay for it themselves, but they participate in the private market.    What the gentleman is recommending, which I think would be a good step, is to put those people, or at least a large portion of those people, in the same community-rated risk pool for the purposes of setting their insurance rates. You are still getting your insurance from the same people. You still have the same freedom of choice in the market and to choose your own health plan with this initial step, but the difference is, instead of you being viewed as an individual for the purposes of setting your rates, or small business, only your 10 employees being viewed together, you have 160 million people that are in the same pool.    So if you or a member of your family, or one of your employees in the case of a small business, has the misfortune to get sick or injured, you don't get that phone call from the insurance company saying, we are going to raise your rates, because you have your rates set by the health status of the pool at large, 160 million people, not just you as an individual or your employees.    I would commend the gentleman from Wisconsin for recommending that. I do think that would be a step in the right direction. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Before the gentleman gets into the energy bill, Mr. Speaker, and we do have a lot to talk about because that's an historic vote that is going to change this country in the long term for the better, I did want to follow up on what the gentleman talked about earlier and was finishing his remarks that about the legacy that this Congress over the past 6 years has left for our children and our grandchildren, the legacy of debt. And I want to take a little walk down memory lane, and we have talked about this before, to think about what happened in the last 4 years of President Clinton's administration, where we had 4 consecutive years of budget surplus, a surplus that was forecast as far as the eye can see. In 10 years the estimated $5.5 trillion surplus, according to CBO, from 2001 through 2010, that was the estimated surplus dollars that we were going to have. And you will recall back in the 2000 election between Governor Bush and Vice President Gore, what was the debate? The debate was what are we going to do with this surplus? We had this enormous surplus, $5.5 trillion. Are we going to pay down the debt? Are we going to shore up Social Security? Are we going to do tax cuts? Are we going to create new programs? Everyone had an idea. You know what? We're not having that debate anymore because instead of having 10 years of budget surpluses, we have had 7 consecutive years of budget deficits, and those deficits are now forecast as far as the eye can see. And to make matters worse, the 10-year projection from 2001 to 2010 because of this administration is a $3.5 trillion deficit, $3.5 trillion dollars in the red. So that's a swing of almost $9 trillion. And I would suggest to my colleagues if you had said to an economist in 2001 at the beginning of this administration's first term, if you had said, how could you possibly come up with the scenario where we would have a $9 trillion swing from positive to negative in the projection of having a surplus to a deficit? Is that even possible? And any economist you ask would say, no, it would be impossible to mismanage the economy to such an extent over just 7 years that you would have a $9 trillion swing. So I sat and listened to the group that came before us, a group that lectured us on fiscal responsibility.  Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman allowing me to speak out of turn.    I have the high order of being asked to do the Speaker pro tempore duties beginning in a few minutes here, and I do greatly appreciate our friend and colleague, Mr. Ellison from Minnesota, for covering for me while I give these remarks, and then I am going to take the chair.    The gentleman hit it right on the head. We would not be having this discussion were it not for this Congress on the very first day we were in session adding transparency to the earmark process. In the past we couldn't have this discussion because earmarks were put in in the dark of night. Earmarks were not identified by sponsor. Earmarks were put in at each stage of the process unidentified. You didn't know where they came from. You didn't know the details of the earmarks.    Now we are able to have a discussion, and every Member of Congress who has an earmark in the bill that we are going to pass this week and send to the President has the responsibility to justify those earmarks. And if the gentleman wants to justify his earmark for cold weather clothing, he's able to do so. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. That is absolutely correct. And you wouldn't be able to look at the final product, at the bill, and look at every single earmark in there. I think they said there were 9,000 earmarks in the omnibus bill that we were passing today compared to 16,000 total earmarks that were in the last Republican budget that was passed. I believe that was fiscal year 2006. And I am going to talk about why fiscal year  2007 didn't have any earmarks. But fiscal year 2006 had 16,000 earmarks unidentified. We couldn't have this discussion. We couldn't come to the floor and talk about who put in these earmarks, who has to justify the merits of those earmarks. But we can have that discussion today because this Congress, on the very first day in session, one of the very first things we did, one of the very first votes that Mr. Murphy, Mr. Ellison, and myself cast as Members of Congress was to add transparency to the process, to shine the spotlight and add sunshine to the earmark process. So now we know.    And I am more than willing to justify the money that I am sending back to my district to help stimulate the economy and create jobs in western Pennsylvania. I would assume that the speakers who came before us are willing to justify their earmarks in there. But don't come down to the floor and lecture us on whether or not there should be earmarks in the process.    And if the gentleman would just allow me to finish, because I do have to take the chair, and again I thank Mr. Ellison.        In FY 2007, I think I said 2005 and 2006, FY 2007, the Republicans who controlled this House at the end of 2006 were unable to complete their work on nine of the 11 appropriations bills.    Now, we heard some rhetoric in the group that came before us, and we've heard for the past several weeks, even months, about how we are not doing our duty because we're putting all these bills into an omnibus bill and sending it to the President before the end of the year. I want to take a walk down memory lane on this, too.    One of the other first votes that Mr. Murphy, Mr. Ellison and myself took, our freshman class, was resolving those nine appropriation bills from last year that the Congress left to us. And that happened because after the elections that Congress said, You know what? We're taking our ball and going home. Forget it. We're not going to complete these nine bills. We're going to leave it for the next Congress. And that next Congress was this Congress. It was the Democratic-controlled Congress. And we finished all nine appropriations bills in a month. And those nine appropriations bills funding us right now, the current operations of the government, contain no earmarks, zero. So we went from 16,000 earmarks the year before last to zero for those nine of 11 appropriations bills that we have today.    So, yes, the omnibus bill that we are passing this week does contain earmarks, but let's not forget the fact that the current year's budget, which we passed in this Congress, had no earmarks. And we were stuck with that right from the start, specifically because the previous Congress failed their job and left it for us to resolve.    And at this point, I will yield to the gentleman from Connecticut. Mr. ALTMIRE. (VETERANS GUARANTEED BONUS ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, today the House will take a huge step towards addressing one of the great injustices affecting our brave men and women in uniform. With today's passage of the Veterans Guaranteed Bonus Act, we will once and for all end the practice of denying combat-injured service men and women their enlistment bonuses that they were promised, that they deserve, and that they have earned.    It defies belief that some of America's combat-wounded veterans were actually sent a bill to repay their enlistment bonuses after they were injured, or that the Pentagon would stop making payments if the bonuses were paid in installments.    The American people were justifiably outraged when this situation came to light. And today Congress is going to do something about it by passing the Veterans Guaranteed Bonus Act. Hopefully, this bill will soon be signed into law and we can demonstrate for our brave men and women in uniform that this Congress will support our troops with our actions, not just our words.  Mr. ALTMIRE. (THE 30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I thank the gentleman from Florida.    And on the subject of Iraq, before we move on to some other things, I did want to discuss a little bit the fact that the Iraqi Government this week announced that they support the creation of a formal timeline, a date certain at which the American involvement in Iraq would wind to a close.    And I think that that's a monumental moment in what we're facing in Iraq because we have, for years now, going on 6 years, been engaged in this conflict in Iraq. And the military men and women, the brave service men and women who serve us over there throughout this conflict have done their job, they have done everything that has been asked of them. We could not ask any more from the men and women, they have done what they were called to do. And that's something that every American can see in the results on the ground. And now, thankfully, the Iraqi Government themselves have recognized that that is the case by announcing their intention to ask the United States for a formal date certain at which point we would wrap up our involvement.        So I find that to be good news. Moving forward, we need to go to the Iraqi Government and say, look, this is your country and we cannot continue to hold your hand and run your affairs for you. It's time for you to step up and administer your own government, administer the affairs of state, and take the reins of power. And I think that by the statements that we heard today, the Iraqi people and the politicians in Baghdad have seen the light on that issue, and I feel like we are moving towards resolution and agreement that it is time to wrap up our involvement in Iraq.    And I would yield to my friend from Ohio if he wants to continue on that, Mr. Ryan. Mr. ALTMIRE. (THE 30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I thank the gentleman. This is exactly what we need to talk about tonight. You have the chart there. The gentleman has the chart talking about turning a projected 10-year surplus--when President Bush put his hand on the Bible and took the oath of office, the projected surplus over the next 10 years was $5.5 trillion.     Now we're in a presidential election year. Mr. Meek referenced it earlier. Let's think back 8 years. Vice President Gore was running against then Governor Bush. What was the debate about? The debate was about what are we going to do with this enormous surplus? That was the whole thing. Remember Vice President Gore had his lockbox idea. Are we going to shore up Social Security? Are we going to pay down the debt? And with that $5.6 trillion surplus, we could have nearly paid off the entire Federal debt by now, 8 years later. We would have it almost completely paid off. Instead, because of the decisions that have been made by this administration and previous Congresses, we have a $10 trillion debt. So instead of having it paid off, it's at its highest level in history, nearly $10 trillion.    We could have, as the gentleman suggests, invested in alternative energies and research and development on alternative sources of energy. We didn't do that. We could have done any number of things with a projected $5.5 trillion surplus.    Well, instead, because of the economic policies of this administration, we have not had that $5.5 trillion to the good; we've had $3.5 trillion in debt. And I would suggest, and we have talked about this before, if you had said to any economist in America, no matter what their political persuasion, in the beginning of this administration, what would it take over the next 8 years for us to have a $9 trillion swing in the projected surplus to the deficit that we would then encounter? What would it take? What type of economic policies would we have to put forward? Any economist you asked would have said, well, that's impossible. You can't possibly mismanage the economy to such an extent that that would be the result, a $9 trillion swing. Well, unfortunately, this administration and the previous Congresses did the impossible, and we are faced with the situation that we are.    Now, pay-as-you-go budget scoring, as Mr. Murphy talked about, is not the only answer, but it's definitely a step in the right direction. And it was President Bush's father, President George H. W. Bush, in 1990 that came to the agreement with Congress to put in place the pay-as-you-go budget scoring that led to the record surpluses of the 1990s following the all-time record deficits to that point of the 1980s.    So this Congress has taken a step to put our fiscal house in order. We can't dig ourselves out overnight. But all of this has led to the decrease in the value of the dollar. And the decrease in the value of the dollar, anyone would agree, is one of the major factors involved in the price of gas today, the price of petroleum in the worldwide market. And we're going to talk about that tonight.    I yield to my friend from Florida (Mr. Meek). Mr. ALTMIRE. (THE 30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I thank the gentleman. I was going to comment on the fact that there is a slogan that you see rolling around these halls, and it is ``drill here, drill now.'' You hear it everywhere we go, drill hear, drill now.    Well, how could we accomplish that goal? Because the Democrats want to drill here and they want to drill now. The way we drill here and the way we drill now is by using the 6 million acres that are already leased and permitted and available for drilling. We need to be doing that now. They are ready to go.    Now, there is exploration that needs to take place, I understand that. But the territory that has not been leased and permitted is 10 years away before the first drop of oil comes out, and it is 20 years, 20 years, before it is fully on line at peak capacity. That is not drilling now. So I would suggest to those who want to pursue that policy, maybe they ought to change their slogan. Just to be more accurate, it should be ``drill here, drill in 10 years or 20 years,'' because that is what they are talking about.    What we are talking about is using the land, the territory, the parts of the Outer Continental Shelf, 75 percent of which is leased and permitted, allowed to drill, and they are not drilling. The oil companies who have the land leased and ready to go on the Outer Continental Shelf are using a quarter of it, 25 percent.    So you will hear people say, well, there is no oil there. Well, that is factually incorrect. Eighty percent of the known oil in the Outer Continental Shelf is located in areas where the oil companies are already allowed to drill. It is already leased. It is already permitted. It is already ready to go. Go to it. Drill here, drill now. That is what we are talking about. Have at it. We want you to do that, big oil. Do it.    Now, if you want to talk about drilling here in 10 years and drilling here in 20 years, that is a different ball game, and we can have that discussion after they have used the land and territory already available. Mr. ALTMIRE. (CONGRESS WILL CONTINUE TO FIND REAL SOLUTIONS INSTEAD OF CASTING BLAME -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, Congress continues to take action and do everything we can to reduce the price of gas at the pump. Because of legislation this Congress passed last week, as of last week there are over 70,000 more barrels of oil per day every day that are going into the market instead of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And during the last week, the price of oil per barrel went down.    We also approved legislation that gives U.S. authorities the ability to prosecute anti-competitive conduct committed by international cartels like OPEC that manipulate the price of oil.    We passed legislation that would invest in biofuels rather than corporate welfare for Big Oil. Energy experts estimate that biofuel blends are keeping the price of gas approximately 15 percent lower than it would otherwise be right now.    This Congress has taken action to address the skyrocketing price of gas, and we will continue to find real solutions rather than pointing fingers and casting blame. Mr. ALTMIRE. (SBIR/STTR REAUTHORIZATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I thank the chairwoman for yielding.    Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of the Small Business Innovation Research Program Reauthorization Act.    Since its inception in 1983, SBIR has been key to American competitiveness, providing quality research for the U.S. Government and spurring technology innovation. SBIR has been a catalyst for some of today's most successful enterprises. For over 25 years, SBIR has allowed innovative small businesses to partner with the government for the development of today's most cutting-edge goods and services. SBIR is a program designed to stimulate American competitiveness.    This legislation we consider today will ensure that SBIR will keep pace with the technological changes and advancements in today's ever-changing, high-tech world to keep our Nation's small businesses competitive in the global economy.    The region I represent in western Pennsylvania has produced a number of SBIR success stories, ranging from new medical therapies to advanced computer technology. The area is an emerging medical- and technology-based community that is home to some of the top research and development in the entire country.    Reauthorization of SBIR will allow us to continue to foster research and innovation that will translate into a wealth of new employment opportunities and economic growth for western Pennsylvania and the entire country. Mr. ALTMIRE. (SBIR/STTR REAUTHORIZATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Madam Chairman, I would like to thank Congressman Ellsworth and Congressman FOSTER for their leadership in joining me today in offering this amendment.    Our amendment clearly states that any small business that is either owned by or employs illegal immigrants will not qualify for SBIR funding. By adding this language, we clarify that Congress will not reward those small businesses who fail to play by the rules.    As we know, SBIR awards are critical to assisting our Nation's small businesses compete, and Congress must ensure that those monetary awards paid for by the American taxpayer are not provided to those small businesses that purposefully contribute to our Nation's ongoing illegal immigration problem.    This amendment is absolutely necessary because of those bad actors who choose to ignore the law and hire individuals who are not in this country legally.    I urge adoption of our amendment to guarantee protections for American small businesses.    Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Madam Chairman, I am prepared to accept the amendment.    I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ALTMIRE. (THE DEMOCRATIC BUDGET -- (House of Representatives - March 21, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Madam Speaker, Democrats this week complete committee work on a 2008 budget that finally moves us away from the fiscal irresponsibility, reckless spending and record deficits of the past 6 years. When President Bush first came into office, America had just had 4 consecutive years of budget surplus, forecast to continue as far as the eye can see. Now, 6 years later, Republicans have turned a projected $5.5 trillion surplus into a $3 trillion deficit. They borrowed more money from foreign nations in the past 6 years than we had in the past 212 years combined.    Fortunately, Democrats have a new set of priorities, one that moves America towards a balanced budget for the first time in 6 years. Mr. ALTMIRE. (DIFFERENT PRIORITIES ON FEDERAL SPENDING -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, President Bush said this week that there are important differences between Republicans and Democrats when it comes to  spending, and he's right, because for 6 years, President Bush joined with Republicans that led this Congress on the most fiscally irresponsible budget policies in the history of the Nation. They turned the record surpluses of the 1990s into the record deficits we face today, and while they ran up those record deficits, inconceivably they cut medical research. They cut Head Start, they cut clean water programs, and they cut health care for our Nation's veterans.    Mr. Speaker, the Democratic budget balances the budget within 5 years, and our appropriations bills comply with pay-as-you-go scoring. We passed Homeland Security and Military Construction and Veterans appropriations bills last week, and this week we'll pass an Energy and Water bill that includes renewable fuel and reduces our dependence on foreign oil.    So you see, Mr. Speaker, the President's right; we do have different priorities on Federal spending. Mr. ALTMIRE. (URGING REAUTHORIZATION OF SCHIP -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Madam Speaker, today House Democrats unveiled the Children's Health and Medicare Protection Act. It was endorsed by the National Governors Association, a bipartisan group of our Nation's Governors, who just last week asked us for urgent action to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program.    The SCHIP program that we are reauthorizing will ensure that millions of children have access to high-quality, cost-effective health insurance, and it will protect and strengthen the Medicare Trust Fund.    Now, while the President's budget underfunded this program, knocking 1 million children off of the rolls of the SCHIP program, I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join us in a bipartisan effort to show support for the SCHIP program and reauthorize and support the Children's Health and Medicare Protection Act. Mr. ALTMIRE. (PAUL WELLSTONE MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION EQUITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, last March Congressman Kennedy came to western Pennsylvania to hold a hearing with me and Congressman TIM MURPHY about the critical need for mental health parity legislation. Now, almost exactly 1 year later, I am proud to rise in support of the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act. This much-needed legislation will eliminate the discrepancies between health insurance coverage for mental and physical illnesses by ensuring that patients seeking mental health services are no longer penalized with higher copayments and coverage restrictions.    Passage of this bill is a key step towards ending the stigma surrounding mental illness. Of the 44 million Americans living with mental illness, two-thirds did not receive the treatment they need. Treating mental illness is not only critical to mental health, but also prevents physical ailments that arise when mental health conditions go untreated.    So, Mr. Speaker, this bill will help improve the mental and physical well-being of millions of Americans, and I ask my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. ALTMIRE. (SMALL BUSINESS INVESTMENT EXPANSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairwoman, Ms. Vel&#225;zquez, for her assistance in putting together the Small Business Investment Expansion Act. I appreciate the opportunity I have had to work with Mr. Chabot and Mr. Graves, to work with both of them to produce a bipartisan bill that will benefit small businesses across this country. Their input was invaluable, and I thank each of them for their leadership.    I represent a district that extends north of Pittsburgh which is home to world-class universities. Western Pennsylvania has thousands of small business innovators who are doing cutting-edge research and development in the life sciences. Western Pennsylvania's entrepreneurs have created numerous success stories; however, many of these companies did not become success stories overnight. Each of them had their challenges. Unfortunately, thousands of small businesses are formed each year that are unable to take that next step and overcome the capital expenses necessary to keep their businesses afloat during the early going.    Part of the problem resides within the Small Business Administration's investment programs. The current Small Business Investment Act was written in 1958 and simply did not envision the type of capital environment that exists today in the 21st century. This antiquated law has led to inefficiencies in the SBA that contribute to an annual shortfall of $60 billion in unmet capital needs for American small businesses. Small businesses often require an infusion of private investment to purchase additional assets, such as equipment, office space and personnel. But the private investment can be difficult to acquire.    To address the substantial unmet capital needs of small businesses in western Pennsylvania and across the country, I introduced the bill we are  debating today, the Small Business Investment Expansion act. My bill will improve the environment for small businesses by expanding access to two vital sources of investment: venture capital and angel investments. Not only do small businesses require investment capital, they also require support that will allow them to do research and development. Current regulations prohibit a number of these small firms from qualifying for support offered through Federal initiatives due to their venture ownership. With this legislation, we can create a fix that reflects the reality of today's climate, that there are many small companies entering into industries that depend on this type of investment as their primary financing option.    Small businesses are the backbone of our economy. It is critical that the Federal Government do more to connect these small firms with the capital investment required for them to succeed. This bill modernizes the SBA's investment programs and creates an environment that facilitates the flow of capital to small businesses. This bill will create jobs, grow the economy, and help thousands of entrepreneurs grow from startups into thriving small businesses.    Mr. Chairman, for that reason, I strongly support this bill. I encourage my colleagues to vote for it. Mr. ALTMIRE. (SMALL BUSINESS INVESTMENT EXPANSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I thank the chairwoman and the ranking member. I think the way that we worked together as a committee to resolve this issue is a model for the way this Congress should operate. The ranking member voiced some concerns about the bill and deferred in the process to get it to the floor so he could offer his amendment on the floor.    There are some outside groups, I know, that are concerned about title V. We want to alleviate their concerns on this issue and get the support of the entire small business community on this. Hopefully, with this amendment, that is going to happen.    Mr. Chairman, none of this would have happened without the support of the ranking member and the way that he handled this issue. I really want to thank him for offering this amendment. I think this is going to secure the bill for some of the groups that have concerns. I also accept it and I encourage my colleagues to support the ranking member's amendment. Mr. ALTMIRE. (HEROES EARNINGS ASSISTANCE AND RELIEF TAX ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 20, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, my friend and colleague from the great State of Pennsylvania.    Mr. Speaker, last fall I introduced the Active Duty Military Tax Relief Act to assist our brave men and women in uniform who are serving our country with honor and distinction, and I am pleased that significant provisions proposed in my bill are incorporated in their entirety into the bill we are discussing today, the bipartisan HEART Act.    Serv\\x1cice\\x1cmem\\x1cbers are often confronted with transitional issues when called to duty, and the bill we are debating today includes provisions from my bill making essential tax relief for our military families permanent by providing incentives to ensure that Reservists who are called up for active duty do not suffer a pay cut. This bill also makes it easier for veterans to become homeowners, and it includes other provisions from my bill allowing recipients of the military death benefit gratuities to make contributions of up to $100,000 into tax-favored accounts, such as Roth IRAs and Education Savings Accounts.    Mr. Speaker, we spend a lot of time in this Congress talking about supporting our troops, and we are providing further evidence today that we are going to support our troops with our actions and not just our words. The HEART Act is another sign of our commitment to our Nation's heroes, and I encourage all of my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. ALTMIRE. (CHANGING THE WAY CONGRESS DOES BUSINESS -- (House of Representatives - May 23, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, Democrats continue to demonstrate that they are changing the way Congress does business. We reach across the aisle to pass bipartisan legislation that puts the American people first. Just last week Republicans and Democrats came together to provide a much-deserved pay increase for our troops serving bravely overseas. We joined together to fight crime by adding 50,000 cops to the street, and we passed an affordable housing bill that keeps the people of the gulf coast on the road to recovering after Hurricane Katrina.    We also accomplished something last week that 3 of the last 5 years Congress was unable to do: come to an agreement on a sensible budget with the Senate. It is a budget that prioritizes our Nation's veterans and achieves balance without raising a penny of taxes. Mr. ALTMIRE. (TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY HEALTH ENHANCEMENT AND LONG-TERM SUPPORT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 23, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, our brave service men and women are returning from Iraq and Afghanistan with TBI at an alarming rate. Sixty-five percent of the soldiers at Walter Reed today have been diagnosed with traumatic injury, and thousands of veterans have mild TBI, but have not been diagnosed. And I'm concerned that the VA has not been properly diagnosing and treating those veterans with traumatic brain injury.    As has been mentioned today, traumatic brain injury is the signature injury for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. This is why I introduced the Veterans Traumatic Brain Injury Treatment Act, which has been included in its entirety in this legislation we're debating today. My bill would improve the diagnosis and treatment of TBI for our Nation's veterans by requiring the VA to screen veterans for symptoms, develop and operate a comprehensive program of long-term care for postacute TBI rehabilitation, establish TBI transition offices at all polytrauma network sites, and create and maintain a TBI health registry.    In addition to improving the diagnosis and treatment of traumatic brain injury, this bill will improve the VA's research of TBI and ensure that the VA provides better care to veterans in rural communities.    I want to thank the subcommittee chairman, Mr. Michaud, and the full  committee chair, Mr. Filner, for their leadership on this issue, for including my legislation in its entirety in this bill, and I want to urge my colleagues to support this piece of legislation. Mr. ALTMIRE. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 13, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.    I can understand why there would be some confusion on the other side about why we would need to move these appropriations bills in a timely manner because, yes, the fiscal year starts October 1. So what is the urgency, I'm hearing.    I can understand why there is a lack of recognition of the urgency because in the 12 years, Mr. Chairman, that the Republican Party controlled this House, they were able to complete all the appropriations bills on time exactly zero times. They were unable to do it any time in the 12 years they controlled this House.    So, yes, I understand there is some confusion about the process and why it is important to get these bills out on time.    If anyone is interested, the last time that all the appropriations bills were completed on time was 1994, which perhaps, by coincidence, was the last time the Democrats controlled the process in this House. So we do understand the urgency of getting these bills done on time; and we do understand that October 1 is going to be here and we need to complete work on these bills.    Certainly, what has happened in the House the last couple of days, and I would expect is going to happen over the remaining course of the week, and perhaps months, does not bode well for our ability to do that because we are facing a lot of obstruction. I think it would be instructive to talk about what is actually in this bill rather than talk about the procedural gimmickry which is going on to prevent us from passing this bill.    The bipartisan Homeland Security Appropriations bill provides critical funding to improve the Nation's homeland security and implement the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, which have languished for more than 4 years now. One of the first things we did in the first hours of this House was to vote to implement the 9/11 Commission recommendations. This bill moves us in that direction; it enables us to do that with the funding that is required. I don't think that is something that should wait any longer. We have already waited 4 years from those recommendations. We have waited almost 6 years since 9/11 to see this take place.    This legislation strengthens border security. I hear a lot of talk about border security and immigration. This bill provides emergency first responders with additional training and equipment, and improves aviation and port security, all important aspects of the 9/11 Commission recommendations.    We talk about immigration reform. This bill makes border security the top priority by devoting substantial resources to secure our borders not only against potential terrorists, but also to help stop the growing flood of illegal immigrants entering our country each and every day, totaling more than 12 million at this time.    In this bill, we invest in our Nation's most pressing security needs by hiring 3,000 additional border security agents. That's what we are talking about, we are going to secure the borders. We include $1 billion for fencing. I think that is as important to people on the other side of the aisle as it is to people on our side of the aisle. I don't know why they're delaying this; that $1 billion goes to fencing infrastructure and technology along the U.S.-Mexican border.    We commit $2.1 billion to illegal immigrant detention and removal. We hear about this ``catch and release'' program as part of the immigration debate. This bill stakes a step in solving that problem. We are in the process of debating that. Let's get it done. Let's stop all the delaying tactics. Let's get this bill done.    This bill provides $550 million in State homeland security grants which are used to hire, train, retain and equip emergency first responders. Is there anyone in this House who doesn't think that's an important priority that we should make a priority and get this bill through the legislative process?    This bill increases funding for firefighter assistance grants. Unfortunately, the President recommended a 55 percent reduction. We put that money back in because I don't know that we can come up with any more important segment of our society than our firefighters, the brave men and women who put their lives on the line every day here at home to keep us safe.    We improve aviation security by doubling the amount of cargo screening on passenger aircraft, another key recommendation of the 9/11 Commission. So these are not things that should be delayed.    We invest in port security by providing $400 million in grants to improve critical port facilities and infrastructure. And this Homeland Security Appropriations bill includes strong oversight measures to ensure careful spending of taxpayer dollars. I want you all to hear that: It eliminates the wasteful, no-bid contracts that have led to billions of dollars in losses.    The Acting CHAIRMAN. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. ALTMIRE. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 13, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Chairman, what this bill does is give our brave men and women who respond to emergencies the tools and resources they need to protect our communities. I can think of no better way to show the American people that we are committed to this.    I urge my colleagues to support this bill.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Texas. Mr. ALTMIRE. (VA FUNDING HONORS COMMITMENT TO VETERANS -- (House of Representatives - June 13, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, after years of neglect, this House is finally going to take up a VA funding bill that honors our commitment to our Nation's veterans. In contrast to the chronic underfunding that the VA has seen in recent years, this bill that we are going to talk about today has the largest increase in VA health care spending in the 77-year history of the program.    And for the first time, this bill exceeds the recommended funding level of the service organizations, the American Legion and the VFW.    Democrats continue to demonstrate our commitment that no group should stand ahead of our Nation's veterans when it comes time to make Federal funding decisions. This bill will help us clear up the 400,000-case backlog at the VA. It is going to help us avoid issues like what happened at Walter Reed, and it will give our veterans the care that they earned and the care that they deserve. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - October 31, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. And this is something that's critical to understanding the tax policies that we're going to be considering in the remaining time that we have in the 110th Congress.    The alternative minimum tax, as the gentleman is pointing out, is something that has to be addressed. We simply cannot afford to ignore this issue any longer. We've been in a position where we have been giving 1-year fixes year after year. For 1 year we hold harmless the folks that should qualify for the AMT as it's currently written with that flawed formula, and we push it off another year, and it gets more expensive to fix every time we do that.    And what the gentleman from Connecticut is talking about is it was a flaw. In 1969, they created the alternative minimum tax to prevent people from escaping their tax obligations. They couldn't use deductions and loopholes and whatnot, and they didn't index it for inflation. So now we're 38 years later, and the income of 1969 that was considered rich at that point, due to 38 years of inflation, we have a different outlook on that.    So we have a situation where the alternative minimum tax is spiraling out of control. And you gave numbers, 4 million people affected by it this year. If we do nothing, it is going to be 23 million next year. So we can't ignore the problem, and our friends on the other side of the aisle can pretend like that's not part of the equation and this is not something that we have to deal with or this isn't going to have a cost. And I know this is something you're going to address later in your remarks and we can discuss that, but to say, well, we should just do nothing about this or we should pretend like this isn't going to have a budget impact is just not consistent with the facts.     So the alternative minimum tax is there. It's the reality. It's existed for 38 years. It's spiraling out of control, and we're very close to being in position where if we were to scrap the entire income tax system, that would cost less than to do away with the alternative minimum tax. We're only a few years away from meeting that threshold.    So what do we do? Well, Chairman Rangel has put forward a plan that is not the only plan that's going to be discussed. It's not the only plan that's going to be offered, but it's the starting point for the discussion, and he has said that this needs to be a permanent fix. And I know in the other body they're having the same discussion, that it needs to be a permanent fix. We can't continue to do this year after year after year, and it just gets more expensive.    So this is the starting point. We have to think about that when we talk about tax policy, that this is unmistakable that we have to deal with the AMT. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - October 31, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Just to clarify, as the gentleman from Ohio understands, this was not the reduction that you see there in that chart. This was not a governmentwide reduction in costs where we were tightening our belts and doing the right thing and being fiscally responsible and we happen to lower the costs in the consumer safety section by reducing some payroll over there. This was the biggest spending administration and the biggest spending Congress in the history of the country. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - October 31, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. As the gentleman points out, it's a matter of setting priorities. It's not as though they were lowering the cost of government across the board. They picked and chose what they wanted to lower, and one of the issues they thought wasn't important and we didn't need to deal with was consumer safety.    Now, I think we would all agree that consumer safety is incredibly important and especially what's happening with the Chinese imported toys, and to have dramatically less people working in that department this year than we did last year, than we did 5 and 6 and 7 years ago is outrageous.    But I did want to put it in perspective that we are raising the debt incredibly, $3 trillion and counting in the last 7 years of this administration. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - October 31, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I have two little girls, 8 and 6, Natalie and Grace, and I have in my home some of those toys. I can tell you as a parent these are not toys that are fringe. You talk about Sponge Bob Square Pants and Dora and Thomas the Tank Engine, those are mainstream toys. Those are in families and houses all across this country. And to think that the Consumer Product Safety Commission doesn't have the resources to adequately monitor these toys coming in with exaggerated levels of lead, dangerous levels of lead from the Chinese, as a parent it makes me very angry, but as an American it makes me angry because I know all across the country there's kids right now that are playing with those very toys. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - October 31, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I know the gentleman didn't have the number in front of him when he was talking about it, the number of toys just from China that were recalled last year. This is this year, the number of toys that we imported, this is the number of toys that were recalled, is 20 million, 20 million toys just from China that were recalled this year, and we have one employee at the Consumer Product Safety Commission that's reviewing those toys.    But we may have people out there that are watching us tonight that say, well, I don't have kids, I don't have toys. It doesn't affect me. Let me tell you, it does affect you. Let's talk about food safety and let's talk about what's happening right now with regard to that.    Just with China, recalls this past year ranged from bag spinach and peanut butter to contaminated wheat flour, all from China. That has brought fear to the Nation's kitchen tables. We have tainted food coming in from China as well.    I am not going to test my friends from Ohio and Connecticut, but I will tell you up front, less than 1 percent of our food imports are inspected. That is a shocking number. That surprised me. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - October 31, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I appreciate that. I want to talk about one of those hearings that we are talking about, the oversight hearings the President says is a waste of time.    Well, I would ask the American people if they think that the House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Emerging Threats has a hearing to investigate the Federal Government's efforts to protect our food supply chain, and the issue that I talked about where 1 percent of our food imports are inspected, I don't think that's a waste of our time. I don't think the gentleman thinks that's a waste of our time. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - October 31, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I want to put this in perspective. I would like to bring this down to the level of the average family and what they are consuming when we are talking about some of these recalls with regard to food safety, and so people can understand at home what we are talking about.    I have a list in front of me, and I won't read through it all, because it's an incredibly long list, unfortunately, the recalls that have taken place just this year. Just this year. We are at the end of October, the last day of October, today.    But a couple of the big ones that stand out, I am sure everybody remembers back in February the peanut butter recall due to salmonella contamination, huge issue, people were sickened all across the country. The level of that recall, 326 million pounds of peanut butter across the country, and that, primarily, would affect children, children eating their peanut butter.    We had a 55,000 cantaloupe recall. Now, that came from Costa Rica, because of salmonella, just to show you how across the board this is. We had 9.5 million bottles of Listerine that were recalled due to a microbial contamination, and that was in April.    Throughout this list, month after month, there are multiple recalls involving millions of pounds of ground beef for a variety of illnesses that it caused, so ground beef, and from a number of different countries that we are talking about importing.    We have food recalls involving apple juice, 113,000 units of apple juice were recalled in August.    Then, lastly, everything up through pot pies, we just had this month, they were recalling pot pies due to salmonella contamination. So when we talk about 1 percent of the food imports into this country are inspected, it affects our entire food supply. Yes, this is a health issue, but this is also a national security issue. That's why we are having some of these hearings that we are talking about.        And I'm very grateful that we have been joined by the distinguished colleague of ours from Florida, Miami, Mr. KENDRICK MEEK; and I would, at this time, yield to him. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - October 31, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I thank the gentleman from Ohio. I have people all the time in my district, Mr. Speaker, that come up to me and talk about that passport issue that Mr. Ryan mentioned. We had hundreds and hundreds of travelers over the summer months that needed the help through our office, and I'm sure you had the same experience because of that 500,000-case backlog at the State Department. They were unable to deal with it. They put forward this regulation. They didn't have the resources to deal with it, very similar to what we're talking about with the Product Safety Commission. These are the types of things that we are holding hearings on. We're trying to get to the bottom of it. And when the President talks about, well, we're wasting our time by holding our hearings, I'm not sure what his inference is. I'm not sure what he would have us be doing, because it's not as though we haven't been doing our work here in this Chamber, because tomorrow, we begin the 11th month of the year, and  through the first 10 months, as the gentleman knows, this Congress, the 110th Congress, compared to any other Congress in the history of the country, the 109 that came before us, through this date and time, this Congress has met more often and taken more votes than any Congress in the history of the country, bar none. So for the President to insinuate that we're holding these hearings and doing nothing else, again, it's inconsistent with the facts. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - October 31, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I know we're very short on time; so we'll turn it over to Mr. Murphy shortly to close out.    But you talked about combining these appropriations bills and the criticism that we received from the other side. I wanted to remind my colleagues of the last time that this happened. It was very recently. We shouldn't need to remind them. It was just in February. And the reason we had to combine nine appropriations bills from last year in this session of Congress was because, after the outcome of the elections in 2006, the Republican Congress said, I'm done, I'm going home. I don't care about these nine appropriations bills. We'll leave it for the next group to fix. And that is what we had to deal with when we came in, nine appropriations bills that were not completed from the previous fiscal year. We were in the current fiscal year doing last year's work. So I couldn't believe what I was hearing today on the floor when we were being criticized for combining three appropriations bills in the current fiscal year when they left us with nine bills incomplete that we had to deal with. Mr. ALTMIRE. (WELCOMING THE REVEREND DON GREEN -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Madam Speaker, it is my privilege to rise today to introduce Pastor Donald Green as today's Guest Chaplain. I have known Pastor Green for many years through our involvement in the McCandless Rotary Club, which is just one of the many service organizations to which Pastor Green lends his time in western Pennsylvania. He is truly an extraordinary man, and it is an honor to present him to you today.    Pastor Green has led a number of trips abroad to assist in various relief efforts. His travels have taken him to Kenya and Zambia to visit projects funded by the Lutheran World Relief and Lutheran World Federation. In 1997 he visited missions in India, and in 1999 he took a group of volunteers to Puerto Rico to assist in hurricane relief. He also led a group of volunteers to Madagascar to lay the foundation for a youth center, which now bears his name, the Pastor Don Green Youth Center. These are but a few examples of Pastor Green's commitment to his community and commitment to service above self.    Pastor Green now serves as the Executive Director of Christian Associates of Southwestern Pennsylvania. He and Kathy, his wife of 36 years, are the proud parents of three children and one grandson.    On behalf of my colleagues in the House, Pastor Green, welcome and thank you for your many years of service. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - October 24, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, I wanted to follow up on a couple of points that the gentleman from Ohio mentioned, one of which was this idea that, well, these kids who don't have insurance can just show up at the emergency room. What I hear people who are of that mindset say is this SCHIP program is too expensive, there's not enough money to cover these kids and, therefore, I don't want to pay for them; somebody else can worry about that, send them to the emergency room.    But here's the problem with that way of thinking. We do pay for it when they show up at the emergency room. They show up there, they get covered, and, as the gentleman indicated, an earache that could have been knocked out with antibiotics turns into something more serious, a cold turns into pneumonia. Other situations that could be easily treatable, they instead turn into bigger health problems. We all pay for that because, in this country, when a hospital has uncompensated care or debt based on the fact that people don't have insurance but still show up for treatment, we are the ones that pay for that.    The reason that when you go to a hospital an aspirin will cost $15 is because of the cost shift that takes place when somebody, one of these children without health insurance shows up at the hospital, usually in the least cost effective way possible in the emergency room. So that is what happens when the President or someone else says, Well, let's just send them to the emergency room and everything will be fine. We are paying for that. That is why health insurance premiums go up, that is why costs are skyrocketing, and that is the cost shift that takes place.    On another point, I wanted to mention, and we are talking about our successes, some of the things that have happened in this Congress, I wanted to relay a story that took place over the weekend. I was holding a town hall meeting in my district and we were taking questions and someone asks the question, Well, when are you guys going to do something about the cost of college? I have got a kid in college. When are you going to lower the cost of higher education?    I said, That is a great question and I want to apologize to you because you should be aware of the fact that we have done something about that. This is not something that is on the drawing board or just passed the House or is awaiting signature. This has been signed and enacted, $20 billion of relief for parents and students for higher education. The largest expansion of higher education funding since the GI bill in 1944 passed this House, passed the Senate, and has been signed into law by the President.    Maybe we haven't done as good a job as we should be doing in getting the message out. This is a major legislative victory for this Congress and for this country. We cut in half the interest rate on student loans, from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent, which, by itself, if we did nothing else, would save the average student borrower in this country $4,400 by itself.    But that is not all we did. We increased Pell Grant funding to $5,400, the largest increase and the highest amount available in history, in the history of the Pell Grant program. We increased funding for Perkins loans.    We increased the availability and the types of students and the types of schools that can qualify for Perkins loans. Just as important, we capped at 15 percent of discretionary income the amount that the student borrower will be required to pay in paying back their loans.    So they will not be forced into debt over their heads, and they will be able to have a more manageable debt burden when they graduate and when they start in the workforce and their income is not that high. These are good achievements. That was all in that bill.    So what I said to the person who asked this question was, this was something you took the time to show up at the town meeting to ask this question. This was the number one issue of concern to you, and that is why you asked me this question. And we did something about it. This Congress has  helped you on the issue that is of the greatest concern to you. It is going to help millions of Americans, parents and students around this country, afford higher education, afford the cost of college.    We have had tremendous legislative success. As you have talked about, more days in session, more rollcall votes, more legislation passed, than any Congress in recent history, maybe in the history of the country to this date. So we have legislative success.    I wanted to not let the time go by without talking about that College Cost Reduction Act, because that is going to affect people's lives.    So I yield back now to the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Meek. Mr. ALTMIRE. (COMMENDING THE WEST VIRGINIA UNIVERSITY MOUNTAINEER FOOTBALL TEAM FOR WINNING THE 2008 TOSTITOS FIESTA BOWL -- (House of Representatives - January 28, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 938) commending the West Virginia University Mountaineer football team for exemplifying the pride, determination, and spirit of the Mountain State and overcoming adversity with skill, commitment, and teamwork to win the 2008 Tostitos Fiesta Bowl, as amended.    The Clerk read the title of the resolution. Mr. ALTMIRE. (COMMENDING THE WEST VIRGINIA UNIVERSITY MOUNTAINEER FOOTBALL TEAM FOR WINNING THE 2008 TOSTITOS FIESTA BOWL -- (House of Representatives - January 28, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Today I rise to congratulate the West Virginia University Mountaineers for their amazing win in the 2008 Fiesta Bowl.    Four short weeks ago, West Virginia University captured its third consecutive bowl victory and cemented their third consecutive top 10 finish. They defeated the University of Oklahoma Sooners 48-28. College football fans throughout the Nation were treated to an exceptional college football game.    I want to extend my congratulations to West Virginia head coach Bill Stewart, athletic director Ed Pastilong, West Virginia University president Mike Garrison, and West Virginia's student athletes for winning the Fiesta Bowl.    I also want to extend my congratulations to the Oklahoma Sooners and their student athletes for a great season. Oklahoma won the Big 12 championship game and had an 11-2 regular season record.    The WVU Mountaineers were pregame underdogs against No. 3 ranked Oklahoma, whose defense had previously allowed only 92 yards a game. The exceptional play of Mountaineer quarterback Pat White, the Fiesta Bowl offensive MVP, helped the Mountaineers produce 525 yards of total offense. Reed Williams, the Mountaineer linebacker and Fiesta Bowl defensive MVP, helped his teammates hold the Sooners to only six points in the first half and a total of 28 points for the game.    Mr. Speaker, once again I congratulate the West Virginia Mountaineers for their success.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ALTMIRE. (COMMENDING THE WEST VIRGINIA UNIVERSITY MOUNTAINEER FOOTBALL TEAM FOR WINNING THE 2008 TOSTITOS FIESTA BOWL -- (House of Representatives - January 28, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, we have a colleague who represents Morgantown, West Virginia, with us, Mr. Mollohan, and I know there is no greater fan of the West Virginia Mountaineers than he. I am sure he is justifiably proud; so I will yield him such time as he may consume. Mr. ALTMIRE. (COMMENDING THE WEST VIRGINIA UNIVERSITY MOUNTAINEER FOOTBALL TEAM FOR WINNING THE 2008 TOSTITOS FIESTA BOWL -- (House of Representatives - January 28, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, just to tie this whole thing together, we have just celebrated the LSU Tigers' national championship and West Virginia's championship in the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl. As a Member from western Pennsylvania, I would like to take a brief moment and remind my colleagues of the role the University of Pittsburgh played in this whole scenario, because were it not for the improbable upset that the University of Pittsburgh was able to pull off on the last game of the regular season, we may have been doing these in a little bit different order than we were today. So I congratulate West Virginia and LSU. But I did want to put in that plug as well.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ALTMIRE. (COMMENDING LOUISIANA STATE UNIVERSITY TIGERS FOOTBALL TEAM FOR WINNING 2007 BOWL CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP GAME -- (House of Representatives - January 28, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the Louisiana State University Tigers football team on winning the 2007 Bowl Championship Series national championship game, and to congratulate the players, coaches, and LSU fans on a tremendous 2007 football season.    On January 7, 2008, the LSU Tigers took on the Ohio State University Buckeyes in a newly reopened Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans. The 2007 BCS national championship game was a treat for fans all over the Nation, and a celebratory moment for New Orleans as the Superdome observed its return to hosting big events after the destruction caused by Hurricane Katrina. And it was quite a celebration as the Tigers defeated the Buckeyes 38-24.    Ohio State got off to a 10-0 start, but LSU never backed down and went on to score 31 unanswered points. Led by game captains quarterback Matt Flynn, safety Craig Stelz, fullback Jacob Hester, punter Patrick Fisher and defensive tackle Glen Dorsey, the Tigers proved that they deserved to play in the championship game.    This Tigers team played with extraordinary heart all season. In 2007, LSU beat seven nationally ranked teams, and their only two losses each came in triple overtime games. A very talented senior class created a sense of urgency throughout their leadership, and the rest of the team never stopped playing with heart throughout this record-setting season.    Defensive tackle Glen Dorsey won four prestigious awards, including the Lombardi Trophy, and has been a model player off the field as well by encouraging young people to ``dream big'' this year. Quarterback Matt Flynn threw 21 touchdown passes this season and had a career high of four touchdown passes during the championship game. Finally, Jacob Hester rushed for 1,103 yards and scored 12 touchdowns during the 2007 season. This was truly a multi-talented team.    I want to extend my congratulations to Coach Les Miles and the rest of the LSU coaching staff. The players and staff have come together to create a preeminent football program with a record two BCS titles in just the past 5 years.    In his tenure as head coach at LSU, Miles has led his team to three bowl victories and an impressive 34-6 record. Congratulations are also in order for the dedicated State and university community. The avid Tiger fans have supported their team all season and helped to set a Superdome record of 79,651 people in attendance for the BCS championship game.    In the words of former Governor Kathleen Blanco, the Tigers ``embodied Louisiana's fighting spirit.'' The entire State deserves to celebrate this title and begin to look forward to the 2008 season.    Mr. Speaker, once again, I congratulate the Louisiana State University Tigers football team, and I urge my colleagues to pass this resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ALTMIRE. (COMPREHENSIVE AMERICAN ENERGY SECURITY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. My friends on the other side of the aisle, those who stood in this darkened House Chamber for weeks asking Congress to return to vote on a drilling bill, will bemoan the fact that this bill is not identical to their bill, but no one in this House, Republican or Democrat, got everything in this bill that they wanted. Every one of us could find something we would like to take out, something that was left out that we would like to put in, or language that we would like to change. But that is how the legislative process works. The finished product is a result of give-and-take compromise put together in a way that can pass by majority vote. That is what we're here for, right? To pass an energy bill.    But the truth is, Mr. Speaker, those on the other side have been a part of this process. For months, we've heard their cries of ``drill here, drill now.'' For months they have talked of nothing else. So here we are today taking up a bill that triples the territory that is available for offshore drilling. And during the 6 years the Republicans held control of both Congress and the White House, they had the chance to write the bill exactly as they wanted. And during those 6 years, they did nothing to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and nothing to advance their ``drill, baby, drill'' war chant. For 6 years the American people watched and waited for the Republicans to act but got nothing in return.    So now it's our turn, and today we will pass a bill to expand offshore drilling. So to my Republican colleagues, I say their voices have been heard. Their views have been included. And they should take ``yes'' for an answer. Mr. ALTMIRE. (NATIONAL CAPITAL SECURITY AND SAFETY ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman.    When the D.C. City Council decided to ignore a ruling from the United States Supreme Court and when the District of Columbia decided to play games with the Constitution of the United States, it was they that brought us to the point where we are today, where congressional intervention is necessary to uphold the rights of Washington, D.C. citizens under the second amendment to the Constitution.     As a signatory of the amicus brief urging the Supreme Court to overturn the unconstitutional gun ban, I was outraged at the D.C. Council's new gun restrictions. So I joined with Mr. Childers of Mississippi to help craft the Second Amendment Enforcement Act, which is the text of the amendment we are debating here tonight.    This bill repeals D.C.'s gun ban and permits law-abiding gun owners the right to keep their firearms in ways that will ensure their availability and use for self-defense. This amendment ensures that the intent of the Supreme Court and of the second amendment are upheld for all citizens, including those who live in the District of Columbia. Mr. ALTMIRE. (I-376 TECHNICAL CORRECTION -- (House of Representatives - April 30, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, today the House will complete work on the technical corrections bill for the Federal Highway Transportation Act. This bill includes a project that is critical to my district, the future I-376 corridor.    Pittsburgh International Airport is the only major airport not currently on a Federal interstate. This has hurt the region's ability to compete and limited business development along the highways that lead to it. The redesignation of Pennsylvania Routes 22, 30  and 60 as Federal Interstate 376 is critical to future economic development and the marketability of western Pennsylvania. Completion of the project is also contingent on safety upgrades at two separate interchanges.    With today's passage of the technical corrections bill, we are taking one more step in advancing the I-376 designation and in making the regional priority a reality. I thank the chairman, Mr. Oberstar. Mr. ALTMIRE. (EFFECTS OF TROOP DEPLOYMENTS -- (House of Representatives - April 30, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I appreciate the gentlewoman's kind remarks and yielding me the time. And I appreciate my colleagues who have been here allowing me the opportunity to speak because I do have to take the chair. And I want to thank the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Braley) for his patience while he waits for me to step up to the plate.    I really think it's important for us to consider the work that this Congress has done on these issues. And we've spent a lot of time tonight talking about the problem; and that's very important. But it's important that our colleagues and the American people understand what we've done about it. We're not just in a position where we're going to talk about what's wrong. And we know the issues.    There's 700,000 children in America where the head of the household has been deployed. 700,000 children that are missing a parent right now because they're deployed overseas. 19,000 children have had a parent wounded in action. 22,000 have lost a parent in Iraq or Afghanistan.    And we have 40 percent of active duty servicemen and women that are married. So, Mr. Space talked about the effect of the spouse, certainly in the tragic extreme, but even when they're deployed and all of the circumstances that arise.    And just today, the American Psychiatric Association released a study focused on the mental health effects of deployments on servicemembers and their family. And that study, again, by the American Psychiatric Association, said that over 30 percent of military family members admitted to being very stressed because of the deployment.    Five years into the war in Iraq, one out of five, 20 percent of those family members surveyed, did not realize that they had the ability to access mental health care treatment to help them with that stress.    And I know we've talked tonight, and it's well documented, the increase in spousal abuse that takes place upon the return from active duty service.    So what has this Congress done? And there are many examples we can give. The largest increase in the 77-year history of VA. We've talked many times.    I wanted to talk about one specific amendment that took place which I offered to the Defense Authorization Bill that dealt with family and medical  leave, and extending the current Family and Medical Leave Act to cover the family members of military, Guard and Reserve members who were deployed, because we obviously need to allow time to work with families in those post-deployment briefings that often take place during the work day. They can't get time off work when they're gathering with their peers from the region to learn what's happening overseas and what the updates are for what's available to them. They should be able to take that time for family medical leave.    Household expenses, getting their financial house in order, dealing with child care issues, all of these are things that are now covered under family medical leave because of the actions of this Congress. This has been signed into law.    Importantly, when the serviceman or woman is injured overseas, you can take Family and Medical Leave Act time to care for the injured serviceman or woman. That's incredibly important. That's going to fundamentally change people's lives, and that's something that this Congress did.    But most to the point of what we're talking about with this study from the American Psychiatric Association and other evidence that exists, we allow family members to take Family and Medical Leave Act time to re-assimilate, as a family, after the serviceman or woman returns from their deployment so they can get to know each other again, spend time with their spouse, spend time with their kids. That is incredibly important. That is a huge achievement of this Congress, and that's something that I'm very proud of, that this Congress has done. That's been signed into law, and it is going to have a major impact on the lives of our brave servicemen and women who are fighting for this country.    So I just wanted to tell that story before I took the chair. And again, I would thank Mr. Braley, and I would yield back to the gentlewoman from Florida. Mr. ALTMIRE. (BUSH ADMINISTRATION WILLING TO BAIL OUT BEAR STEARNS BUT NOT STRUGGLING FAMILIES -- (House of Representatives - April 01, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Madam Speaker, last month the Bush administration approved the Federal bailout of an investment giant, Bear Stearns. You would have thought that the crisis on Wall Street would have opened the administration's eyes as to what is happening on Main Street. Reminiscent of Herbert Hoover, President Bush continues to oppose any efforts by this Congress to address the extreme hardships of Americans struggling in today's economy. House Democrats have crafted a foreclosure prevention package that would help stabilize the housing market, and Senate Democrats have similarly been working on legislation to help struggling families keep their homes. But rather than support such efforts, President Bush has threatened to veto the bill, and Senate Republicans voted to block it from even coming to the floor for a vote.    Madam Speaker, it's time President Bush and Republicans recognize that the crisis affects Main Street as well as Wall Street, and they should join us in our efforts to help families hard hit by this economy. Mr. ALTMIRE. (COLLEGE COST REDUCTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, when I was elected to the House of Representatives last November, I asked to serve on the Higher Education Subcommittee specifically so I could help make college more affordable for American families, and this bill does just that. It raises Pell Grant awards to their highest level in history. It cuts in half the interest rates students will pay on their student loans, and this bill rewards community service by providing loan forgiveness for those who choose careers in important fields like first responders, law enforcement, firefighters, and nurses.    And we do all of this at no additional cost to the taxpayer. This bill is fully funded, and I am proud to have played a part in crafting this important legislation. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, I wanted to talk about what we did today. We have had a fantastic couple of weeks with the 100 hours, and we are going to talk a lot about that, but today specifically we did something that is going to impact just about every American with children in this country. We cut the interest rate on student loans in half. And currently interest rates are 6.8 percent; we are going to cut them down to 3.4 percent, and that is going to have an impact on people all across the country.    I wanted to take a few moments today and talk about what this is going to do for students in my district and for the impact per college in my district.    I have a college called LaRoche College where I served on the board of trustees for two terms. It is in my district. It is a private liberal arts college, and for students who are entering this year, over the lifetime of their loan, they are going to see savings of $2,120 over the time of this loan. And because this is phased in over 5 years, for students in 2011, for those parents who may have children that are going to enter college in 2011, over the lifetime of their college, if they go to LaRoche College, they are going to save over $4,000. On average across the country, it is over $4,500, and I think that is something we can be proud of in this House of Representatives. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I would say to that criticism, and we all heard it today on the other side, that there is an immediate reduction. We are not cutting it in half immediately, but there is a reduction for students who are going to  go into college this fall. You are going to see a reduction in your interest rates for student loans, and if you are a parent of children who are deciding where to go to school, maybe entering high school right now and they are deciding to go to college in the year 2011, the interest rate is going to be half of what it is today, and that is because of the action we took in the House today. And I was proud to cast my vote.    In Pennsylvania, we have the fifth highest cost of tuition in the entire country as a State, and we have some great State universities like Penn State. Everybody knows about Penn State. There are 32,000 students on student loans at Penn State University who are going to benefit from what we did today, and the ones who are entering school this year have a $2,250 lower payment over the course of their loans. Students who enter Penn State in the year 2011 are going to see a reduction in what they pay over the lifetime of their loans of $4,360.    That is real savings, and there is nobody on the other side who can say that we have not taken strong action here today. So I am proud of what we did today, along with all the other action we have taken in the last 2 weeks. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Absolutely. And I was also back in the district this weekend and I heard the same things that we are talking about. There is a sense of excitement, that it really is a new day in America and this Congress has instilled a sense of confidence that has not been seen in this country in a very long time.    And if you look at what we have done here over the past 2 1/2 weeks, as the gentleman from Ohio said, some would argue that is more than the previous Congress did in the past 2 years or maybe longer, and we have done that in the first 100 hours of business here in this Congress, and we are going to keep going when this is over. And I am excited that tomorrow we are finally going to complete that first 100 hours agenda, and then we are looking forward from hearing from the President thereafter.    But what we have done, no one should overlook the fact that this is extraordinary. What we have done here in the beginning of a new Congress with a turn in the leadership and a new group leading, we have taken right from the beginning when we looked at the lobbyists and special interests and took away the meals and the travel and the golf outings and the gifts that have been prevalent here in Congress over the past several years, and then we moved right into the pay-as-you-go where we had a system where 6 years ago we had come off four consecutive budget surpluses.    That seems like an extraordinary thing now. We had surpluses as far as the eye can see in the year 2000, and now you look back, the President is going to give us in a couple of weeks his seventh consecutive budget that is out of balance, running a deficit, and that is unacceptable. And the reason that has happened is because they allowed pay-as-you-go budget scoring, which is what we all do in our home checkbooks. You have to have money on one side of the ledger to pay for it out of the other. That is what all the families do at home, that is what I do, that is what we all do. But that is not what Congress has done. Congress has just been able to spend freely without having a revenue source on the other side.    So we are going to make the necessary cuts to balance the budget, which is something that fiscal responsibility has not been a part of the congressional landscape over the past several years. We did that on the very first day.    We followed that up with implementing the 9/11 Commission recommendations. Who can argue that we need to implement the recommendations to make this country more secure? Well, they had languished in the previous Congress. We took care of that the first Monday when we got back after the weekend.    Then we moved on to minimum wage. We raised the minimum wage for the first time in 10 years. Is there any other group of citizens that didn't even get a cost of living adjustment let alone a pay raise over the last 10 years? We did that with a bipartisanship vote. As the gentleman from Florida pointed out, these are not things that the Democrats are supporting on their own and ramming it down the Republicans' throat. These are issues that get bipartisan support.    We moved on to embryonic stem cell research; then we did Medicare prescription drugs; today we did student loans. These are issues that affect every American and working families across this country.    So I would yield back to the gentleman from Florida for him to continue this, but I just want to reemphasize how proud I am to have been a part of this historic beginning of a new session of Congress. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I would welcome the gentlewoman from New York as well, who has become a good friend.    This is an issue I hear about every day. It is an issue that we get calls about in our office every day. Mr. Murphy and I were discussing earlier the fact that we had been back in our districts for the first time this past weekend. I have to tell you, everywhere I went, this issue resonates with people because they see it every day. When they drive past the gas station and they see the price, and of course it is winter season now and we are having a little bit of a cold spell where I come from in western Pennsylvania, and I know New York and Ohio and Connecticut, as well, but probably not in Florida, Mr. Meek's area. But this is an issue we hear about because home heating is a big part of this as well.    So it affects everyday Americans and it affects working families. I think it is appropriate on the last 100 hours as we hit the finish line that we are going to address an issue, like the others that we have discussed, that really has a day-to-day impact on working families all across this country. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Well, one of the things that has struck me in our first few weeks here, and I'm sure my new colleagues would agree, is that these are issues that, as we discussed, should not be controversial. Somehow, 71 Members on the other side voted against cutting the interest rates on student loans in half. Somehow, Members on the other side voted against raising the minimum wage for the first time in 10 years.    As I said during the debate on the floor last week, how could anyone vote against or even argue against allowing Medicare the right to negotiate group discounts on behalf of their 40 million beneficiaries to lower the cost of prescription drugs for every Medicare beneficiary? How can anybody be on the other side of that?    So what has struck me is, yes, we are getting bipartisan support, and we should all be grateful for that, but there are still folks on the other side who are arguing against these things. And what is amazing to me is, how is it we are able to pass these with such bipartisan support now, 300-plus votes today on the student loan bill, when in the past they couldn't even come up for a vote. Wouldn't even bring them up on the floor for a vote. Now, in the first 100 hours, we have done all these things.    So I just can't say enough about the new leadership in Congress and how well the entire Congress, including the other side, has worked together to make these things happen, and I just look forward to continuing my service over the next 2 years and working on these issues.    It is such an exciting time, and I am grateful to the gentleman from Florida for allowing me to join him this evening, and now I would yield for closing remarks to Mr. Ryan. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I wanted to, Mr. Speaker, remind my colleagues that are here with us tonight if they wanted to share with their constituents, our website for this working group, it is www.speaker.gov/30something. Or they could send an e-mail directly or have their constituents send an e-mail directly to 30somethingdems@mail.Ðhouse.gov. And at this point I would like to yield back to my friend, the gentleman from Florida. Mr. ALTMIRE. (THE 30 SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - November 14, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, thank you.    We are here tonight with part of the 30 Something Working Group, and we are going to talk about what this House has been doing this week. We are here, it's late into the evening, and we have been working throughout the day on a variety of issues, and we are going to be at work tomorrow. I wanted to talk with my colleagues tonight. And we are going to have a full house. We are going to be joined by Mr. Murphy from Connecticut, Mr. Meek from Florida, Ms. Wasserman Schultz from Florida, and Mr. Ryan from Ohio. We are going to have a discussion about some of the things that this House has been doing.    We took several significant votes this week, including the vote that was just discussed on Iraq. And we are going to discuss the policy in Iraq and the vote that we took today.    I wanted to start by talking about the President's veto earlier in the week of the Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill. Now, the President has found his veto pen, something that on appropriations bills he had not used until this Congress. And I think it's instructive to begin this debate by reminding my colleagues, as if they needed reminding, that we are talking about an administration that took office after 4 consecutive years of record surpluses, 4 consecutive years of budget surpluses, that were forecast to continue as far as the eye can see. In fact, the 10-year projection for budget surplus beginning in 2001 was more than $5 trillion of surplus over that 10-year period.        Well, what have we seen instead of that? We've seen seven consecutive budget deficits in the 7 years of this administration, deficits that are forecast to continue as far as the eye can see. And instead of that $5 trillion in surplus, we've seen more than $3 trillion in deficits in just 7 years.    So, this administration that's now lecturing us on fiscal responsibility and vetoing our appropriations bills, criticizing us for spending, this administration saw more than $8 trillion flip from a projected $5 trillion surplus to $3 trillion in deficit and counting. So, that's the context of what we're talking about.    So, we sent to the President the Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill, which includes programs like low-income energy assistance, home heating, the LIHEAP program. Now, I don't think there's anyone in this country that has not been affected by the price of oil. And home heating is something in the Northeast where I'm from in Pennsylvania, and in Connecticut where Mr. Murphy is from, and in Ohio where Mr. Ryan is from, the price of home heating has continued to skyrocket. And we're going to get into some of the numbers, but that's one of the things that's in this bill. Well, I don't think that's excessive spending, to help people who would otherwise have their heat turned off.    We're talking about funding for community health centers. We're talking about funding for Head Start, a program for early childhood education. Is there anything more important in this country than early childhood education, making sure our children get off to a good start and begin their educational careers in a way that we're able to ensure that they get off and they're positioned to have the best start possible.    Now, what about medical research, the National Institutes of Health?  That's what we're talking about in this bill, funding for medical research. Is there anyone in the country that thinks we shouldn't be spending money to find cures and treatments for debilitating diseases across the board? That's what this bill is. That's what the Labor-HHS-Education bill funds, and the President vetoed that bill. And we're going to have a vote in this House to override that veto, and it's going to be a very close vote. We were two votes shy of having a veto override majority when the bill passed the House the first time. Two votes. That's what stands between us and overriding the President's veto.    And I would remind my colleagues as well that we were able to override the President's veto just last week. This is not something that can't be done. We had a Water Resources Development Act that had not passed in 7 full years. It's supposed to be reauthorized every 2 years. Congress after Congress, in recent years, has been unable to pass that bill, so we passed it. And we faced a Presidential veto; the President vetoed it. We were able to override that veto overwhelmingly, 300-plus votes in the House; they got 79 in the other body. And what's in that bill? That's another bill that the President, and I outlined his record on fiscal responsibility and he wants to lecture us on spending, for infrastructure improvements in this country. Building levees in New Orleans, does that sound like pork? Building flood prevention infrastructure all across this country.    There were projects in that bill in almost every congressional district in the country to prevent flooding, to help the waterways infrastructure in a way that we're investing for the first time in 7 years in flood prevention infrastructure. So we overrode that veto overwhelmingly. We do have the opportunity to do it again on the Labor-HHS-Education bill. And we're going to talk more about that.    At this time, I want to yield to my colleague Mr. Murphy from Connecticut. Mr. ALTMIRE. (THE 30 SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - November 14, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I wanted to mention one other issue that was in that bill. We talked about home heating assistance. We talked about health care for children, medical research. We talked about the Head Start program, but it's the Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill. And one of the programs that's in that bill that the President thought was excessive spending was additional 200,000 slots for job training for dislocated workers. And I can tell you, coming from western Pennsylvania where we know about dislocated workers and the need for job training and people to readapt when companies move and with the loss of manufacturing jobs, those are critically important programs that the President considers to be excessive spending. That's what we're talking about with this bill. That's what type of spending we're talking about. Mr. ALTMIRE. (THE 30 SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - November 14, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. And the last thing for context, before I turn it over to Ms. Wasserman Schultz from Florida, you will remember, Mr. Murphy and I both being freshman, the excitement of that first week in Congress and the things that we did that first week when we were first sworn in at the beginning of 2007. Well, perhaps the most important thing that we did was return to pay-as-you-go budget scoring, which is very simple. It's the same thing that we all do in our own checkbooks at home and the same thing every business in America has to do. It says that you have to have money on one side of the ledger if you want to spend it on the other, pay-as-you-go. If you want to decrease revenue or you want to increase spending, you have to find a way to pay for it, an offset, you have to find an offset. And every spending bill and every authorization bill that we have passed out of this House this year, every single one of them has been compliant with pay-as-you-go. It has paid for itself; it's been budget neutral.    So, the context of this debate with the President about his willingness to veto these bills and saying it's excessive spending, the American people should be aware of the fact that that's in the context of our returning to pay-as-you-go budget scoring. That's what led to the record surpluses of the 1990s that I referred to earlier. And the failure of this Congress to renew pay-as-you-go budget scoring in 2002 is what led to the record deficits that we're mired in today.    So, when you hear about the vetoes of these spending bills, please keep in mind that we're talking about bills that are compliant with pay-as-you-go budget scoring, bills that are budget neutral and that have the appropriate offsets when there are spending increases.    I would yield at this time to my good friend, Ms. Wasserman Schultz from Florida. Mr. ALTMIRE. (THE 30 SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - November 14, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. That is a perfect segue for what I wanted to get into right now, and we are going to, I think, conclude on this topic because this is certainly the most important issue facing the country today is the war in Iraq. I think anybody would agree. What this House did today is, as the gentleman from Florida talked about, try to get a handle on this situation and try to put a plan in place where none exists today on what our mission is going to be in Iraq.    I was going to talk a little bit about what we did today in the House, what the bill said, and I will turn it over to Ms. Wasserman Schultz to go into a little bit more detail. H.R. 4156 requires the redeployment of U.S. troops from Iraq to begin within 30 days of enactment with a target for completion of December 15, 2008. It requires transition in the mission of U.S. forces in Iraq from primarily combat to force protection and diplomatic protection, limited support to Iraqi security forces and targeted coun\\x1cter\\x1cter\\x1cror\\x1cism operations.    The bill prohibits deployment of any U.S. troops not fully equipped and trained. Is there anybody who can disagree with that? Waivable with a presidential national security certification. So it gives the President the ability to waive that requirement if he feels it is necessary. It extends to all U.S. Government agencies and personnel the limitations of the Army Field Manual on permissible interrogation techniques. That means no torture, something that this House has voted on in the past. It is in the Army manual today. It just says you have to abide by what is in the Army Field Manual as it is currently written. And finally, as we discussed, it provides $50 billion to meet the needs of the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan but defers the consideration of the remainder of the President's nearly $200 billion request.    So this is a responsible course of action. The House passed it today.    I will yield to the gentlewoman from Florida at this point to give her views on this issue. Mr. ALTMIRE. (LABOR-HHS-EDUCATION APPROPRIATIONS BILL -- (House of Representatives - November 14, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Madam Speaker, the Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill passed by Congress reinvests in our Nation's future in a fiscally responsible way, and it is fully paid for with no deficit spending.    The President vetoed this bill because he apparently believes that a better course of action would be to deliver massive cuts in critical domestic priorities, such as funding community health centers and medical research grants through the National Institutes of Health.    The Labor-HHS-Education bill vetoed by the President strengthens education by training 51,000 more teachers, and helps 173,000 more dislocated workers with job training and employment.    And again, unlike the budget-busting funding bills that were passed by previous Congresses and signed by this President, this bill is fully paid for and does not add one penny to the Federal deficit.    Madam Speaker, we must override the President's veto and pass this fiscally responsible bill. Mr. ALTMIRE. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, at long last, after months of debate, negotiation and compromise, the House and the Senate have come to agreement on a children's health reauthorization that's going to extend health care coverage to 10 million children in this country. And last night, I'm proud to be 1 of 265 Members of this House that supported that legislation and voted to send that bill to the President.    This is bipartisan legislation. We have agreement with both the House and the Senate, but unfortunately, the House does not have the votes to override the veto at this time.    I'm asking my Republican colleagues, please consider the 10 million children that are going to lose access to health care coverage if this bill is not passed, if the veto is not overridden. We must override this veto.  These are working families that play hard, that work hard and play by the rules, and we have to find a way to ensure their children. Mr. ALTMIRE. (ANOTHER 4 YEARS OF FAILED POLICIES ARE NOT NEEDED -- (House of Representatives - September 23, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, while the $700 billion Wall Street bailout that we are considering this week is proof of the failures of the economic policies of the past 8 years, we should not forget the policies that President Bush and the Republicans tried unsuccessfully to enact.    Imagine what we might be facing now had Republicans been successful in privatizing Social Security and tying its benefits to the stock market. And it was none other than Senator John McCain who just this month said that the American health care system would be better off if it were run more like our banking and financial markets.    Well, thankfully we didn't follow Republicans in tying Social Security to the stock market, and we didn't take Senator McCain's advice to run our health care system like we run our financial system.    Mr. Speaker, our Nation simply cannot afford another 4 years of the same failed policies that got us into this mess in the first place. Mr. ALTMIRE. (THE EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 06, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Madam Speaker, the new Democratic Congress continues to listen to the concerns of middle-class Americans.    We know that average American families have actually lost ground over the past several years, even after several years of economic growth and high corporate profits. Wages are stagnant, personal debts are at an all-time high, and individual savings are at an all-time low. Higher education and health care costs are skyrocketing.    Last week, the Democratic Congress took a step towards helping middle-class families by passing the Employee Free Choice Act, which helps Americans join together to bargain for better wages, benefits and working conditions.    Once again, our legislation passed with bipartisan support, and once again, it will benefit working families across this country. This is just one more example of how the new Congress is leading this Nation in a new direction, just as the American people asked us to do last November. Mr. ALTMIRE. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Madam Chairman, I'm proud of this budget because it continues on the great work that we did last year after years and years of chronic underfunding of the veterans health care system. We added $13 billion in funding for the VA, which is the largest increase in the 77-year history of the VA, and that was great work. And we are following that up this year by adding $4.9 billion in increased funding and including steady increases over each of the next 5 years.        This budget is true to our American veterans.    In contrast, the President's budget, which does include a modest $1.7 billion increase this year, it decreases funding in real dollars over the next 4 years, and over the 5-year period, contains a cut in veterans health care spending. And there are 120,000 new veterans entering the system this year. Is there anyone in this body that thinks that health care costs aren't going to go up, that the number of veterans isn't going to go up, people entering the VA health care system? And instead of following the President's lead and cutting veterans health care spending, we're increasing spending to the largest levels in history.    It's endorsed by the VFW, the American Legion, the Vietnam Veterans of America, just to name a few. And this funding means that we're going to clear up the 500,000 case backlog that currently exists in the VA due to that chronic underfunding that took place over the past several years before we increased funding last year. It's going to make improvements at VA clinics, help keep up with growing populations of veterans, including in my home district a $180 million expansion of the VA health care facility.    It's going to increase research on traumatic brain injury and prosthetics to help our wounded warriors and our wounded veterans. It's going to help us recruit and retain the highest quality health care professionals to ensure that our veterans get nothing less than the highest quality health care available anywhere in the country right at our VA centers.    So, lastly I would say to the gentleman, we have stepped up to the plate. We are going to support our veterans not just with our words, but with our actions. We're going to continue the great work we did last year with a $4.9 billion increase this year.    I thank the gentleman for his leadership. Mr. ALTMIRE. (HEALTH CARE -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. And I want to commend Dr. Kagen for his leadership on this issue. As all of our colleagues know, Dr. Kagen, right from the very start, has made health care his priority here in Congress using his expertise.    I have a health care background as well, health care policy is my professional background, and the gentleman and I have spoken numerous times about the importance of health care. And I wanted to come down today to talk about the need for health care reform as we are currently discussing, but also just to commend the gentleman for his continued leadership on this at a time when clearly the political system is in unchartered waters, with a Presidential election that is going on around us, divided governments, we have a Congress with the House and the Senate that are having issues with other things going on.    But we continue to see the health care system get worse and worse. And I think the gentleman and I agree on many things, but most importantly on the need to do something about the health care issue right now. It would be very easy to say let's kick the can down the road another year. We'll come back here in March of 2009 and everything will be different and we'll take up health care then. That's great. You know what? When next year comes along, we are going to take up health care. And there is a variety of differences of opinion on what the approach should be for health care reform, how expansive do you want it to be.    But there are things that we can do now, this year, in this political environment, that are realistic. And that's what the gentleman and I have been discussing. We want to do things this year that would be considered, if not low-hanging fruit, at least issues that we can all agree on or most can agree on that we can pass and set the table for a further discussion next year on health care reform.        We have a country where there is over $2 trillion that gets spent every single year; 17 percent of our GDP goes to health care. And I don't think in my district there's an issue that I hear about more often than health care reform when I go around and visit my constituents, and the reason is this is an issue that affects everybody. It's not just your wallet. Obviously, a $5,000 premium, as Dr. Kagen was describing, something that we can all relate to, the exponential increases in health care costs. Small businesses every day in this country by the thousands have to make decisions on what to do about their health care costs for their employees. Do they shift the cost to an unmanageable level? Do they stop offering health care? But they know they can't afford it and it affects everything that we do.    $1,500 of the price of your car, if you buy an American-made car, is due to the health insurance costs of the automaker. Your State taxes are higher because of exploding Medicaid costs. Health care is the last remaining item on the table in every labor dispute in the country. That's why those issues come up. And we have a system that in many ways is better than any other system in the world. It's why people from all over the world come here for their transplants and for their high-end, high-tech care. We have medical innovation and technology advances that far surpass anything happening anywhere in the world. That's if you can get in, if you can afford our system.    The problem is when we are compared to other countries as a nation in life expectancy and infant mortality, we're not just in the middle of the pack; we're at the bottom of the pack when compared to other nations. We have tremendous issues. We're talking about 47 to 50 million Americans that lack access to health care. They don't have insurance. There are tens of millions more that live in fear of losing their coverage. They are one accident or illness away from losing everything. So we have major issues to discuss.    Most important, and I know the gentleman is going to deal with this issue at some length tonight, is the fact that if you're an individual or you're a small business owner and one of your employees gets sick or injured, you get a call from the insurance company, and they say guess what, we have to drop you because you've had this incident. And I think everyone can agree that your individual health status shouldn't be a factor in your health insurance rates.    And something that the gentleman has taken a leadership role on, which I'm going to leave him with because I'm on a limited schedule myself, and I appreciate his giving me the time, is talking about ways that we can incentivize the 47 million Americans and others who have insurance to join large risk pools, community-rated risk pools, whether it be the 180 million people in the country that are privately insured, that would be everybody, or metropolitan statistical areas, regional groups, whatever we can agree on. And I realize that there are differences of opinion on how big the group should be. But we can all agree that your individual health status should not be a factor in setting your individual health rates. It should be a larger pool's health status, which would lower the costs for almost everybody.    So at this point I am going to thank the gentleman for allowing me to say a few words and commend Dr. Kagen for his work. Mr. ALTMIRE. (HEROES EARNINGS ASSISTANCE AND RELIEF TAX ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 06, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I thank the chairman for including in this bill legislation I introduced to assist our brave men and women in uniform.    My bill, H.R. 3827, the Active Duty Military Tax Relief Act, ensures that active duty military personnel will be able to treat combat pay as earned income when computing the earned income tax credit.    My bill also allows Reservists called to active duty to make penalty-free withdrawals from their retirement plans. And servicemembers who receive differential pay from their civilian employer will be able to contribute those wages to their retirement plan.    Finally, family members of those killed in the line of duty will be able to contribute up to $100,000 of the military death gratuity into tax-favored accounts, such as Roth IRAs and education savings accounts.    I thank the chairman for working with me to ensure that all of these provisions from my bill have been included in full in this legislation which I strongly support. Mr. ALTMIRE. (HEALTH CARE SYSTEM FOR VETERANS -- (House of Representatives - November 06, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Madam Speaker, as we listen to the politicized rhetoric we are hearing from the other side today, let's keep one thing in mind; there is no group that will stand ahead of our Nation's veterans when it comes time for this Congress to make Federal funding decisions.    This Congress, after years and years of underfunding the VA, this Congress added $13 billion of increased funding to the Veterans Affairs health care system. It's the largest increase in the 77-year history of the VA health care system. We are going to send that bill to the President, and if he chooses to veto it, we have the opportunity to override it. I can guarantee you that the Democrats in this House are going to vote to override it.    Madam Speaker, you tell me who is responsible if the veterans don't receive their funding on time. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Madam Speaker, we're here this evening as part of the Speaker's 30-Something Working Group, and I'm going to be joined by some other members of that group who will be familiar faces to our colleagues who have participated in these Special Orders presentations.    We're going to talk specifically tonight about the budget that the President dropped on our doorstep on Monday. Now, this was an exciting series of days for the American people. We, of course, had Super Bowl Sunday, one of the most exciting Super Bowls we've ever seen. We had Super Tuesday last night, very exciting for all the American people to watch the unfolding for the Presidential election for this year. And in the middle of that, we had Monday.    And what happened on Monday? Most Americans say, well, not a whole lot happened, but in Congress a lot happened because the President put before us a $3.1-trillion budget. Now, the American people may say, well, that sounds like a lot of money, and it is a lot of money. But what does it look like? What does $3.1 trillion look like? Our colleagues may be interested to see that. This, Madam Speaker, is what $3.1 trillion looks like. This is what the President sent us, both electronically and in paper format. This is a very big document, the entire Federal budget as proposed by the administration for the coming fiscal year 2009.    I'm going to talk a little bit about what's in this budget, but before I did that I wanted to take a little walk down memory lane for our colleagues. And many don't need to be reminded of this fact, but in the last 4 years of the previous administration we had four consecutive budget surpluses. And those surpluses, at the end of that administration and the beginning of the current administration, budget surpluses were forecast as far as the eye can see. And there was every reason to expect that the budget was going to be balanced throughout the next administration. The projection over 10 years by the Congressional Budget Office was $5.5 trillion of budget surplus over 10 years. That was the projection.    Well, now we're 7 years, going on 8 years, into this new administration. This is the eighth and final budget that President Bush is going to send to this Congress. And what has been the outcome of this $5.5 trillion surplus? And we talked about the Presidential election, Madam Speaker, and I would remind my colleagues about the debate of the 2000 election. The number one issue that was discussed in that election was, what are we going to do with this surplus? We have an enormous budget surplus, $5.5 trillion, and all the ways that that money could be used. Are we going to pay down the debt? Are we going to shore up Social Security, put that money into the trust fund? How are we going to use this enormous surplus that's facing us over the next 10 years? That was the debate in the year 2000.    Well, in this Presidential election year we're not having that debate anymore because, you see, Madam Speaker, that surplus is gone. That surplus was gone in the first year of this administration. Instead of $5.5 trillion of budget surplus over a 10-year period, we've had $3.5 trillion of deficit spending over the first 7 years of this administration. And I'm going to talk in some detail about what this fiscal year 2009 budget says, and it includes an enormous amount of deficit spending.    What we have before us is a budget that for the eighth time in 8 years continues enormous deficit spending. But we can't lose sight of the fact that when this administration first came into office, that wasn't the projection. That wasn't the way it was supposed to be and that wasn't the way it had to be. But, unfortunately, decisions were made in a fiscally irresponsible manner, and now before us is a budget that is $407 billion over budget. We have a $407 billion deficit for one year, fiscal year 2009, the third highest single year budget deficit ever submitted to the Congress behind only the budget that was sent to us last year by this President, which was $410 billion, and the 2004 budget also submitted to this Congress by the President.    So we have a record here of destroying projected surpluses and creating record deficits. $9.2 trillion of debt, Madam Speaker, faces this country before this $400 plus billion deficit that's been submitted to us.    We can't continue to charge things to the credit card. The way the previous administration turned the all-time record deficits of the 1980s into all-time record surpluses in the 1990s was through pay-as-you-go budget scoring. And that's very simple: It's what we all do in our own home checkbooks. It's what every business in America is forced to do. You have to have money on one side of the ledger to spend it on the other. And if you want to increase spending or if you see a decrease in your revenue, you have to have an offset on the other side to balance it out. Well, those are the rules that this Congress operated under from 1991 through 2001.    Unfortunately, this administration did away, and the Congress, in conjunction at that time in 2001 going into 2002, did away with pay-as-you-go budget scoring. And since that time, before this current session of Congress, every penny that was spent through the Federal Government was charged to the national credit card. We're going to let somebody else worry about it. We're going to transfer this funding to our children, our grandchildren, and our grandchildren's grandchildren. Well, unfortunately, the problem with using credit cards that way is the bill comes due, and the bill has come due, Madam Speaker.    We're going to talk about the coming economic crisis that this country faces, the possibility, if not the certainty, of a recession, and the economic stimulus package that this Congress came together in a bipartisan way to put forward to help resolve that issue. We're going to save that discussion for a little bit later.    But in the discussion over the budget, it can't be lost that in presenting a $407 billion deficit budget before this Congress, that this President has made incredibly deep cuts in some very important programs that mean a lot to a lot of people in this country. Veterans programs, veterans health care, slashed. Medicare cut by $556 billion over 10 years, a cut in Medicare at a time when you're exploding the deficit by $407 billion. And we're going to talk specifically about the misplaced priorities included in this budget.    Before we go line by line and get into that level of detail, Madam Speaker, I do want to turn it over at this point to my 30-Something colleague, Mr. Murphy from Connecticut, who has joined us and is going to give us some detail on what he views this budget to be. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I'm sure the gentleman from Connecticut would agree that it's ironic, given the fact that it was a week ago that we sat here together in this Chamber and listened to the President's State of the Union Address. And I liked some of what the President had to say on fiscal responsibility, challenging the Congress, challenging his administration to take the budget and make tough decisions and be fiscally responsible. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Well, and again, the things that were said as far as fiscal responsibility made some sense, and I was happy to hear them. And you're right, we had not heard them over the past 7 years, and that led to the deficits that the gentleman and I have both talked about.    Now, we sat here and we heard that. And I thought that hopefully that would translate to the President submitting a budget where the actions actually matched the words that we had heard a week ago. Unfortunately, it didn't. The President, a week later, submits to Congress a budget that's $407 billion out of balance. And we're living in a time when the second largest line item in the Federal budget that is before us is the interest on the national debt, which is $9.2 trillion. The second largest line item in this budget is interest on the national debt. Now, that alarms me, Mr. Murphy, and I'm sure it alarms you. And I would want to do something about that if I was submitting a budget before Congress. And I would want to show, having just talked about fiscal responsibility, that I was committed to fiscal responsibility. But, unfortunately, we have a budget that makes all the wrong decisions because it is fiscally irresponsible, it does have misplaced priorities, it does move in the wrong direction as far as increasing the deficit at a time when we already have a record debt, but it cuts programs like Medicare and Medicaid.    This is at a time when more and more Americans are struggling to afford health care, especially senior citizens. And to propose a budget that cuts Medicare by $556 billion over a 10-year period, at the same time freezing payments to hospitals, to nursing homes, to hospices, to home health agencies, it just doesn't make any sense because health care costs aren't going to stop. Health care costs have been going up above the rate of inflation every year for as far as anyone can remember.        The technology that's used for health care, the increase in the amount of baby boomers that are qualifying for the Medicare program for the first time this year, in 2008. The costs of Medicare are exploding. So to just say we are going to cut Medicare over the next 10 years by $556 billion doesn't mean health care is going to be less expensive, fewer people are going to qualify for Medicare, and fewer people are going to use the program. And certainly it doesn't mean that home health agencies, hospices, and hospitals are going to have fewer expenses just because we are going to be reimbursing them. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. And the gentleman knows that there are three legs to this stool that we are talking about. One is the increase in spending leading to the deficit. One is the misplaced priorities of the cuts to programs that are critically important. The third is what's left out of this budget that we all know we have to deal with, and I'm going to save that discussion for a little bit later as we walk through some of these programs. But the full cost of the Iraq war and the cost of the alternative minimum tax relief for this year are not included in this budget. So a $407 billion deficit without even including probably the two largest items that we are going to have to face in the next year, we'll get to that point, but there are a lot of issues here.    When I talk to people when I go back home in the district, I hear a lot about  entitlement spending, and when I go home, I think I can make a pretty good case that Medicare is important and we shouldn't be cutting Medicare at a time when the number of people qualifying for Medicare is rising exponentially and health care costs are going up. I can make a pretty good case, I think, for that. But I will still hear people say, You know what? I'm not on Medicare. That's an entitlement program. I don't care about that. Cut it. It's a boondoggle. Just cut it. I do hear people say that. They're wrong, but they say it. Well, there are some things in this budget that nobody, nobody in their right mind could justify freezes or cuts in these types of programs. And maybe our colleagues are out there and they say, Show me. What are you talking about? What is in the budget that we shouldn't cut?    Well, how about research, health care research through the National Institutes of Health? I think that's something that affects everybody. If you're not directly affected by health care research, you certainly have somebody in your family or you have somebody, a loved one or a friend, that is affected. And let's talk about the type of research that we are talking about.    This budget freezes funding for lifesaving medical research at the NIH, National Institutes of Health, regarding diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, cancer, and heart disease. At a time when our medical technology in this country is greater than anywhere else in the world and our research and our ability to find treatments and cures for these diseases exceeds any time in the history of the planet, we are going to cut funding for medical research for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, cancer, and heart disease? I think, Mr. Murphy, that we make a pretty good case that that's not a cut that should happen.    This budget also slashes funding, and this is inexcusable, slashes funding by $433 million, 7 percent of the overall budget for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, responsible for infectious disease control, prevention programs, and health promotion. So we hear a lot about the avian flu, the bird flu, the possibility of a pandemic through diseases, whether it be a terroristic issue or just something we can't control on the health side. That may be the number one public health threat facing the country right now, the possibility of a pandemic flu, a worldwide spread of some disease, and we're going to take this opportunity to cut the Centers for Disease Control specifically for infectious diseases by 7 percent? That's what we are going to cut in this budget when we are adding $407 billion to the national debt for 1 year? I think it's inexcusable. So I really don't think there is anybody that I am going to run into in my district that's going to say that's a good idea. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Absolutely. And I thank the gentleman for that story. And I've had similar circumstances in my district where people wonder why we are cutting Alzheimer's funding, where they have a loved one who has struggled with that disease.    I also want to talk about education and what this budget does for education. I think just about anyone should agree that's a national priority. Few things in the budget are more important than education. Well, what does this budget do?    This budget freezes education funding, which results in cuts in real terms. And instead of investing in innovation in the classroom, the budget eliminates, eliminates, the $267 million program providing grants to States for classroom technology. It freezes the $179 million mathematics and science partnerships. At a time when we're struggling to compete in the global economy with countries like China and others that are investing heavily in science education, we are cutting it. At least the President is proposing cutting it in his budget.    It freezes targeted improvement and achievement in math and science programs that do that. And instead of making college more affordable, the budget eliminates, completely eliminates, supplemental education opportunity grants; the Perkins loan program, one of the staples of student assistance for higher education in this country, eliminates; and the Leveraging Education Assistance Partnership program, the LEAP program, which many of my colleagues know is necessary to provide financial support specifically targeted to needy students who otherwise wouldn't have the opportunity to pursue a higher education. These are the programs that are being eliminated under this budget. Not frozen, not cut, but eliminated. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. And the gentleman from Connecticut represents a district in some ways that is similar to my district. We both have a manufacturing base that has suffered in recent years as a result of the global economy and a variety of factors. And as the gentleman said, at the very time when we should be finding ways to help people that have suffered as a result of these job losses and a loss of manufacturing, find new job training sources, find educational opportunities for our kids so they can stay in our communities instead of having to leave town, a problem that we are struggling with, I think, probably in both of our districts, the President uses this budget as an opportunity to eliminate, not freeze, not cut, but eliminate vocational education.    And he slashes the Safe and Drug-Free Schools program by 45 percent; afterschool programs by 26 percent; teacher quality State grants by $100 million, which helps incentivize high quality people to go into the teaching profession, people who have other options, who could become doctors or lawyers or chemists or any other profession. We want to incentivize the best and brightest in this country to go into teaching to educate our kids, and everyone knows the importance of what goes along with that. Well, the President proposes cutting the budget by $100 million for that program.    And, similarly, the gentleman from Connecticut talked about the fact that middle-class workers are seeing their wages stagnate and American jobs have been lost, 17,000 lost jobs just last month. And at this time when we should be finding ways to stimulate the economy and create jobs, instead, the President's budget slashes $234 million for job training programs.        Again, not to repeat myself, but it is worth pointing out, in an atmosphere of a budget that creates $407 billion in deficit spending, out of balance, and that slashes employment services more than $500 million in cuts for Americans looking for work. These are people who are motivated, who want to find jobs, who are looking for work, and he eliminates grants to States to provide employment services for job seekers and employers cutting one-stop career centers. These are all programs that my constituents benefit from that get heavily used in western Pennsylvania. We have had manufacturing losses, and we are trying to find ways to retrain those workers so they can move into other careers, educate themselves so they can stay in western Pennsylvania, and what are we doing? The President is proposing cutting these job training programs. It is just inexcusable. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. And the gentleman knows there is another thing that our regions in the country share and that is that we have harsh winters. We have been known to have harsh winters. And another thing that gets cut in this budget inexcusably is home heating assistance. And with regard to energy generally, we have a time where we have all time record energy prices. Families across the country are struggling with finding a way to pay their bills directly related to the price of oil and gas.    And at that time, you would think that the President would view that as a priority in his budget. But instead, it severely cuts assistance to seniors and to families with children in paying their home heating bills through the LIHEAP program, Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, very important in my area in western Pennsylvania. He cuts it by $570 million nationwide, $19 million of which comes from the State of Pennsylvania. And this is going to force States to reduce the number of households getting help through the LIHEAP program nationwide by 1.2 million people. These are low-income families with children. These are senior citizens that simply don't have the financial ability to pay their heating costs, and we are going to knock, with this budget, 1.2 million of them off the rolls. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I think this is exactly why it is important to have this discussion, to walk through these programs in the budget and talk about what exactly are we talking about when we talk about these draconian cuts that we are facing? And as I said earlier, I have people in my district that say, cut it, cut it, Federal spending, we need to cut it. And we do have an enormous deficit. We have an all time record debt, and we do need to find a way to reduce the Federal deficit. Nobody can disagree with that. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I appreciate that. The fact is the Democrats in this Congress have made the tough decisions. We submitted a budget last year, and I am sure we will do so again this year that achieves balance for the first time since the previous administration. Nobody can disagree that there is room for more cuts. There is room for more reductions. But what we want to do here tonight in this 30-Something Special Order is to talk about the programs that shouldn't be cut, the programs that are critically important to this country that the President has made a decision to reduce.    We talked about Medicare. We talked about life-saving medical research. We talked about the Centers for Disease Control, infectious disease prevention. We talked about education. We talked about the LIHEAP program, home heating energy assistance, and unfortunately the list doesn't end there. It is incredible to think that at a time when we are facing a recession in this country driven by a lot of different factors, but nobody can dispute perhaps the number one driving factor over the past several months and maybe the past few years has been this subprime mortgage issue and home foreclosures and people struggling to afford their mortgages, finding a way to make that monthly payment. Despite the growing problems in the subprime mortgage crisis, inexplicably this budget that we are talking about tonight cuts loan counseling for those at risk of losing their homes. The name of the program is the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation. It cuts it by 87 percent, at a time when we are struggling as a Nation with a subprime crisis that the world has never seen before, or at least America has never seen before. At a time when the crisis is at its most acute point, we are going to cut by 87 percent the program that helps those most at risk, 2 million people in this country at risk of losing their homes. The people most at risk of losing their homes are facing an 87 percent cut. It is ludicrous. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. That is right. The gentleman talked about the assumption in the budget being submitted. Because the gentleman wasn't here when I showed this, I want to show the gentleman, as he knows, what $3.1 trillion looks like. This is what it looks like. This is what the President dropped on your desk and mine on Monday. This is the budget we are talking about. So for our colleagues who are joining us late, this is the budget that we are discussing tonight.    The assumption that was made in putting this budget together by the administration, by President Bush, was that Congress would act on the Alternative Minimum Tax, and, of course, we will. We are not going to allow that to lapse, which would result in an increase for 23 million people in the country, a tax increase, 70,000 in my district, I think the gentleman said 80,000 additional in his district. So, of course, we are going to deal with the AMT.    It is tough. It is a difficult way to have to do policy, to do it year-to-year. It is probably not the best way. We made a tough decision in December, we will make another tough decision at the end of this year, and the President knows we are going are to have to do it and we are going to have to pay for it, because that is what we have to do. It is not included in the cost of this $3.1 trillion budget.    I know we are running short on time, so I did want to just summarize a few of the other programs, saving one in particular for the end that near and dear to my heart, that are cut in this budget. Because, again, people say what are we talking about when you talk about all these cuts?    We talked earlier about the subprime mortgage funding and so forth. How about highway funding? Is there anyone in the country that can disagree that we have a national crisis with infrastructure? We had the unfortunate situation last fall with the bridge collapse in Minnesota which highlighted a problem that many knew but really in a very tragic way shined the spotlight on the incredible need that exists in this country for infrastructure improvement, for bridge repair, for highway repair. We simply do not have anywhere near close to the amount of money necessary to fix the roads and bridges that need fixing right now, let alone all the new construction that needs to take place.    The district that I represent, we are talking about funding for bridges and roads and docks and dams along the riverways. Well, with highway funding in particular, the President's budget unbelievably proposes to cut funding for highways by $800 million below the amount guaranteed by the previous transportation reauthorization bill that we did several years ago.    Every $1 billion in new infrastructure investment creates 47,500 jobs in this country and a shortfall in highway revenue is projected in fiscal year 2009, which is what this budget covers. So we have a projected shortfall, yet the President still recommends a $800 million cut. And at a time when we lost jobs in January, who knows how many jobs we are going to lose in the months ahead as we face what may turn out to be a recession, we are talking about a problem that can create nearly 50,000 jobs for every $1 billion in new investment, and we are going to cut $800 million. It makes no sense.    Homeland security, the gentleman from Connecticut talked about the importance of homeland security, which nobody can dispute, perhaps the number one issue facing the country today. Well, so what does the President's budget do? The calculation of his budget excludes $2.7 billion in border emergency funding from Congress, which was approved in fiscal year 2008. When this is taken into account, the President is only proposing to increase less than $100 million for fiscal year 2009 for homeland security needs for the entire agency.    In addition, the budget slashes funding for State Homeland Security Grant programs, first responders, police, firefighters, EMTs, people right out there on the front lines in our communities, many of them volunteers. This President's budget cuts $750 million, 79 percent below the current year's funding level. For firefighter grants, $450 million, 60 percent below, just for firefighter grants, and 79 percent below for all first responders.    It is incredible that this is the budget that was put before us. Who could possibly argue that that is a good policy decision, to cut funding for first responders by 79 percent? Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I thank the gentleman. I am going to talk about the most egregious, in my opinion, of all these cuts. And I know it is hard to believe having walked through them that there could be one in particular to point to. There is one that is particular to my constituents and to something that I support. We are going to turn it over momentarily to our freshman colleague, Mr. Yarmuth from Kentucky, who I am sure is going to talk more about some of these issues.    As Members of Congress, we are all given the opportunity to testify before  the Budget Committee and say here are our priorities. These are the one or two or three at the most things that we care about that we really want to see addressed in the budget.    I was asked over the break that we had in between the first session and the second session during the holidays, somebody came up to me in a shopping center and recognized me and said, hey, you know, how has the first year been? What are your experiences? What are you most proud of?    Without hesitating, for me, what I am most proud of that this Congress did last year was we had the highest funding increase for veterans health care in the 77 year history of the VA. We had to fight tooth and nail. We had to do it over multiple opportunities throughout the year. But in the end, the budget that we passed exceeded even the recommendations of the service organizations. The VFW, the American Legion, the Vietnam Veterans of America, Disabled American Veterans, those organizations every year present to Congress their recommended funding levels for what they feel that they are going to need. For the first time ever, this Congress exceeded that.    So I am very proud of the work that we did as a Congress on veterans. And it was a bipartisan effort. It is something we can be proud to have worked together on.    Well, what does this budget do for veterans, something that I have made my number one priority in this Congress. And I think we as Congress have a good record so far on veterans, and I want to keep that good record going, and I want to prevent the cuts that the President's budget talks about.    It cuts veterans health care by $20 billion over 5 years. Let me repeat that. This budget cuts veterans health care by $20 billion over 5 years and cuts funding for constructing, renovating and rehabilitating medical care facilities in 2009, for which this budget is authorized.    Now, for me, that is very parochial, because I have $200 million of VA health construction going on in Western Pennsylvania, a lot of which is in my district. Two different projects, $200 million. So the President is coming in here at a time when we have the opportunity in Western Pennsylvania to be the preeminent health care system in the entire VA, top notch facilities, he is going to cut the construction funding, and he is going to cut funding even more egregiously for veterans health care by $20 billion.    I am sure the gentleman can agree, there is no group that should stand ahead of our Nation's veterans when it comes time to make funding decisions. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. That is right. I thank the gentleman. We are going to wrap it up as our time has expired. I would only point out on that note that this is the sixth year in a row that this budget raises health care costs on 1.4 million veterans, imposing $5.2 billion in increased copayments on prescription drugs and new enrollment fees on veterans over 10 years. I wish I had more time to talk about that.    At this time I am going to thank the Speaker for the opportunity to address the House this evening with my colleague Mr. Murphy from Connecticut. Mr. ALTMIRE. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill. Having worked for a large academic medical center, I have  seen the promise that embryonic stem cell research holds for Americans suffering from chronic disabilities such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, diabetes, and spinal cord injuries.    We all know people with these disabilities and a vote for this bill is a vote for them. This bill says specifically that it only applies to embryos that would otherwise be discarded by the fertility clinics. So a vote for this bill is a pro-life vote. We must pass this bill for the millions of Americans that suffer from debilitating medical conditions today and the millions more that will tomorrow.    This is something that is deeply personal to me. I am a pro-life Democrat. The reason I am supporting this bill is because this is a pro-life vote. There is nothing more important that we can do in this Congress than to support life. This is a pro-life vote. I urge my colleagues to pass this bill. Mr. ALTMIRE. (AMERICAN PEOPLE CALL FOR CHANGE -- (House of Representatives - April 18, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, Democrats in Congress have heard the call for change delivered by the American people last November. In just 3 months, we restored the necessary oversight of the administration and reformed the ethics rules of the House to lessen the influence of lobbyists and add transparency to the legislative process.    We answered the call for change in direction in Iraq and kept our promise to our Nation's veterans by voting to increase VA health care funding by $11 billion.    We passed meaningful legislation that will help middle class families, lowering the cost of student loans and prescription drugs.    And although we won't be able to dig ourselves out overnight from the mountains of debt Congress and the administration built up over the past 6 years, the new Democratic Congress passed a budget that achieves balance in 5 years without raising a penny of taxes.    In short, Mr. Speaker, we have listened to the American people and changed the way Congress does business. Mr. ALTMIRE. (HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE MIKE M<em>c</em>NULTY -- (House of Representatives - September 22, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I thank the gentleman from New York.    I know it is somewhat unusual to come down from the chair, but I did  not want our colleagues to think nor certainly the American people watching tonight to think that New York has a monopoly on the Mike McNulty fan club, because I certainly count myself as does, I'm sure, every Member of this House in that group.    I've told Michael before that I was a staffer on Capitol Hill in the early 1990s, and people always ask now and asked even then ``Why is it so infrequent that you see large groups of people in the Chamber? You know, you seem to be speaking. There's not a lot of people there.'' It's because people are back in their offices, and they're watching it on TV. At the staff level, you do the same thing. You pay attention to what's happening on the House floor.    As a very young staffer, beginning in 1991, I learned about the House, and I learned about the procedures of the House by watching what was going on. In those days when the Democrats had control of Congress before the 14 years that they lost it, no one served in the chair more than Mr. McNulty. We enjoyed watching him, and I learned so much as a young staffer about this institution by watching Mr. McNulty in the chair.    I just could not sit without thinking of the great, pleasant irony for me that, on this night when we're honoring Mr. McNulty, I was actually in the chair.    So I wanted to come down and tell you that the spirit of Mr. McNulty is certainly going to live in this Chamber for a very, very long time and that the legacy lives on through his many legislative accomplishments and through, I'm sure, the countless--they have to number in the thousands--number of constituent services that you've provided over the years, the countless accomplishments. The spirit will remain within each of us who has had the honor to serve with him.    So I did just want to take a few minutes to say, A, it's not just New York that holds you in high esteem tonight but that I'm a better person for having known Mr. McNulty and that I know I'm a better House Member for having known him. So I thank Mr. McNulty.    I would yield my time back to Mr. Ackerman. Thank you for the opportunity. Mr. ALTMIRE. (ADJOURNMENT -- (House of Representatives - June 28, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Concurrent Resolution 179, 110th Congress, I move that the House do now adjourn.    The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 9 o'clock and 50 minutes p.m.), pursuant to House Concurrent Resolution 179, 110th Congress, the House adjourned until Tuesday, July 10, 2007, at 2 p.m. Mr. ALTMIRE. (ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE WHITE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - June 28, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Thank you, Mr. Hodes. It is an honor to see you here tonight, as well as Mr. Klein from Florida.    We are at our 6-month point. We have one of our freshman colleagues in the Chair tonight. Mr. Hall from New York is serving as the Speaker pro tempore this evening. We are in the Chamber here tonight; we are talking about the first 6 months. We are talking about what is certainly the most important issue facing the country, as anyone would agree, which is the war in Iraq.    We are talking about accountability. As the gentleman pointed out, we have a President that seems to be struggling with accountability right now.    If you look at what has happened in Iraq, we talk about the surge. We are going to have this report in September on whether the surge has worked. We all pray that we get good news in September, that General Petraeus is going  to come in and give us an accurate assessment and, hopefully, that assessment will be that things are turning around.    But it does not appear at this point that that is the case. In fact, as you well know, Mr. Hodes, the last 3 months where the surge has been fully in effect and we have been over there, have been the bloodiest 3 months in the 4 1/2 years we have been in Iraq. The last 3 months have been the worst 3 months. That does not bode well for the effectiveness of the surge.    As you said, we are over 3,500 now that have been killed and 25,000 injured, wounded and that is just a tragic situation.    I was able to tour Walter Reed soon after that incident came to light with the Washington Post, and perhaps you gentlemen did as well. What strikes you when you meet these men and women, they are the bravest and the brightest and the best this country has to offer. To think that we have a situation where we were giving them substandard care in a military hospital, and in the Department of Defense, we chronically underfund our VA health care systems all across the country. So you have the Defense health care system that Walter Reed was a part of, and that was a disgraceful situation; then on the other hand, for the past several years, we have chronic underfunding of the VA health care system.    So when we talk about this administration's record with regard to accountability and what happens after these brave men and women come home, we have the issue of multiple deployments where the Guard and Reserve families have to struggle with multiple deployments and extended deployments going from 1 year to 18 months. Some of these veterans are small business owners or work in small firms where they have to go to their employer and say, I have to go over to Iraq, I have to serve this country. Of course, the employer says, that is wonderful, you have my support. Then they have to go back a second time, maybe a third.    Again, for the ones that own their own business and are the person that is running the business, how are they going to keep that business afloat? It affects the family. It affects the children. This has so many repercussions. Every segment of our society is impacted by it. But we have a President that has been given the views of the American people--we are going to talk about that tonight--but they have been disregarded.    Sixty-nine percent of the American people think we are heading down the wrong road in Iraq and that we need to change course. Instead, we get more of the same. We have an administration that was given a blueprint for success by the Iraq Study Group 6 months ago now, 7 months ago. Instead of following it, or at least looking at it, it was promptly discarded.    We have an administration that has ignored the advice of his generals on the ground. Whenever they tell him something he doesn't want to hear, they have resigned or they are fired. So I lack the confidence that this administration is going to be able to view the Iraq situation as anything more than ``stay the current course.'' We all know that we need a different course.    We were talking about accountability. I did just want to tell one story that is related to the way this administration views our men and women and the families that are serving this country. I had a constituent in town today. She is an 84-year-old Gold Star mother. Her son was killed in 1969 in Vietnam. She has not been to Washington, D.C. She has not seen the Wall with her son's name on it, the Vietnam War Memorial. She called our office 2 weeks ago and explained her situation. She said, ``I am bringing my two daughters, who are obviously grown now. They are the sisters of the serviceman that was killed in 1969. They are going to come down together as a family for the first time.'' Her goal, her life-long dream, was to tour the White House. So we called the White House. As you certainly know, there is a 6-month waiting list. But there is an exception in special circumstances. One of those circumstances, we were told, you were probably told, were for Gold Star families.        They can get in and take that tour of the White House.    So we were told, sure, they are welcome. We sent the information over, and then we promptly got a phone call saying, well, no, no, that exception only works for Iraq and Afghanistan Gold Star families, not for Vietnam era families.    So we had to call back this 84-year-old woman who wanted to see the Vietnam War Memorial and her son's name on the wall for the first time, and wanted to tour the White House, it was her lifelong dream, and we had to tell her well, I am sorry, we are not going to be able to do that, because the White House does not allow that.    Then it came to my attention that we as Members of Congress in very rare circumstances are allowed to take groups down and put them in the line if we appear with them. So I called her and I said, you know, I am going to just do this myself.    So today we took her down and we put her in the line and she got her tour of the White House.    So I sent a letter to President Bush and I said, there is two issues here. One is this policy is ridiculous. How can you justify putting one group of families who have suffered the greatest loss imaginable in the service of our country ahead of another group of families? How can you put one generation of military Gold Star families ahead of another?    The second issue is, what is the policy? Can you explain it? What is the justification for it? And please change it. That was the situation. I was fortunate as a Member of Congress, I was able to get Ms. Boyer in. But, unfortunately, you wonder how many people around the country have made a similar effort and were unable to get in on this tour.    So, I really thought this was a disgraceful situation, and I did want to bring it to the attention of my freshmen colleagues, because this is something that just happened today. And I think it is indicative of the treatment that our military families are getting from this administration.    I talked about the fact that we have had 6 consecutive years prior to this one of chronic underfunding of our VA healthcare system. You see the result at Walter Reed, what happens when you don't provide enough funding for these institutions. Unfortunately, we as a nation were doing that over the last several years.    But this Congress took a step in the right direction to resolve that by providing the largest increase in the history, 77-year history of the VA health care system, and in the 6 months we have been here, we have voted for $13 billion in increased funding for the VA healthcare system.    We have also voted to increase screenings and treatment for traumatic brain injury, which is now the signature issue for the Iraq war veterans. Many of the people who would have perished in previous wars, because of increased technology and military equipment, we have a lot of amputees and we have a lot of head injuries. So the issues we face are different from issues we faced in previous wars with regard to treating the men and women that come home.    So we are going to screen them and we are going to treat them for traumatic brain injury and we are going to make that part of what we are doing in the VA healthcare system.    So this Congress has taken a step in the direction of honoring our Nation's veterans, and I am proud at our 6-month point of our first term in Congress that we can go home over the July 4th recess and talk about the fact that no Congress in the history of the Congress has ever done more for our Nation's veterans than we have, in just 6 months. So I am proud to talk about that. Mr. ALTMIRE. (ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE WHITE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - June 28, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I was struck in hearing my Pennsylvania colleague, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Sestak), I believe the highest ranking military officer ever elected to Congress; and so much of the rhetoric that revolved around the discussion that this House had on Iraq was, you guys don't have any experience, you don't know what you are talking about.    All you want to do is tie the hands of the generals on the ground, and you need to leave this up to the experts.    What we have heard tonight is an expert, one of the military's foremost military experts that we are fortunate to have not only in this House of Representatives, but in our freshman class with us.    We heard a strategy for success, and we heard someone who has been there  and seen it firsthand. What struck me was the fact that the President has probably had these discussions, and he has probably had people come to him and offer solutions. Maybe not the identical solutions that Admiral Sestak has, but differences of opinion. And the problem is, this administration has not shown a willingness to listen to differences of opinion.    I talked about it earlier. Generals are reassigned if they come in with a difference of opinion. Public opinion certainly doesn't matter. The facts on the ground certainly don't matter.    I was watching earlier, and I don't know if you had the opportunity to walk through some of the facts of what is going on on the ground in Iraq right now. We hear a lot of things on TV about, is the surge working, is it not working. I will let my colleagues decide.    In November of 2003, the number of insurgents in Iraq was 5,000. That is a pretty high number. In March of 2007, the most recent month for which data is available, there were 70,000 insurgents in Iraq as estimated by the Brookings Institution. So 5,000, 4 years ago; 70,000, today.    The number of multifatality bombings in May of 2004 was 9; in May of 2007, last month, it was 42. To me that does not indicate that we are making progress or there is a light at the end of the tunnel. And the numbers of people killed, both civilian and American servicemen, we talked about that earlier, it is exponentially more now.    Clearly, we need a new direction, and we need people like Admiral Sestak, like anyone who is willing to take a hard look at this and offer an alternative solution, like the Iraq Study Group. This is a group of experts who got together, spent a great deal of time studying this issue, making very thoughtful recommendations to the American people, to the White House, and they were promptly disregarded.    Not only were they disregarded, but the course of action that they recommended, diplomacy with the other actors in the region, a training force rather than an offensive force, these are things that we are going in the exact opposite direction. We didn't just discard it, we have gone opposite to what they recommended.    I would say once again that this discussion is healthy. We have four of us here that have opinions, and there are a lot of opinions, and that is the way it should be. I would agree with the gentleman from New Hampshire (Mr. Hodes) that I hope the same type of discussion is taking place on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. Unfortunately, that does not seem to be the case. Mr. ALTMIRE. (HEALTH CARE -- (House of Representatives - September 10, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, while some in the minority party and in the Presidential race are trying to recast themselves as agents of change, nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, the Republicans controlled this House for the first 6 years of the Bush administration and in the past 2 years they have done little more than obstruct our attempts to correct the misguided policies of the past.    In the past 8 years, the number of Americans living without health insurance has increased by more than 7 million. Today nearly one in nine children lack health insurance. After retaking control of Congress, we tried not once but twice to ensure that 10 million children had access to health care through the Children's Health Insurance Program, which serves families that are working hard and playing by the rules but can't afford health care for their kids. And although we were able to pass the bill through Congress, President Bush vetoed it twice and Senator McCain recently said that was the right decision.    Mr. Speaker, we must work together to find ways to improve our health care system, especially for our children. More of the same just won't do. Mr. ALTMIRE. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND MEDICARE PROTECTION ACT OF 2007--Continued -- (House of Representatives - August 01, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, I continue to hear my colleagues on the other side of the aisle say that this bill is a move towards government-run health care that will cause seniors to lose their Medicare.    I would suggest to my colleagues who complain inaccurately that Medicare beneficiaries will lose coverage under this bill that, if my colleagues are so worried about that, they should consider the implications of doctors refusing to see Medicare patients, which is exactly what could happen if we don't pass this bill and fix physician reimbursement.    SCHIP is a State block grant program and will remain so under this bill. Nearly every State contracts out the SCHIP program to private insurers. That is far from a government-run program.    These are children who live in families where the head of household works but they don't make enough money to afford health insurance. These are families that work hard and play by the rules but still can't afford health care for their kids. That is what we are talking about here today, Mr. Speaker.    This bill protects and strengthens the Medicare trust fund and invests in our children, and I ask my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. ALTMIRE. (WEEK OF THE YOUNG CHILD -- (House of Representatives - April 14, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I thank the gentlewoman. And I did want to say about our colleague from California, there are a lot of advocates for children and for young families in this Congress, and a lot of us are passionate about those issues, but there is no one who has done more advocacy and has worked harder than Congresswoman Capps, and so I want to thank her for her comments.    I was in my office and I heard that this Special Order was beginning. And the gentlewoman knows the passion that I bring to the table to these issues. Early childhood education is something I have always talked about. I am a member of a board that is not even in my district. There is an organization far outside my district called the Heritage Health Foundation in a town called Braddock, Pennsylvania, and they sponsor an early childhood education center called the For Kids Center. And it's been in existence long enough that you can see the fruits of the labor there. You can see children that have come through the program, that have had access to early childhood education, and compare them to this community that has fallen on hard times, students and children that have not had access at the same level to early childhood education. And what you find is that the students who have gone through the For Kids Center, the early childhood center and have had access to those services test three grade levels ahead of their peers when you test peer to peer.    Early childhood education works, there is no question about it. And the dollars that we reinvest into the system are paid back many times over in the dividends that they pay in the grade levels and testing better and the performance throughout their school, and they get into less trouble and the kids perform better academically. It all builds upon itself.    So when I was elected to Congress, as the gentlewoman said, in 2006, one of the first things you have to do is choose what committee you're going to serve on. And I knew right away that I wanted to serve on the Education Committee because I wanted to work on the Head Start Reauthorization. That's one of the first things out of the gate that that committee was tasked with doing. I was involved with the Head Start Reauthorization, and we were able to get that through Congress because everyone should be able to agree on the need for early childhood education.    In Pennsylvania, we have 7,529 children that are standing in line for child care. In the chart that the congresswoman from California (Mrs. Capps) showed, you can see Pennsylvania; 7,529 children that should have access to child care and early education services, but don't.    So I want to thank the gentlewoman from Florida for her friendship and her leadership. As she mentioned, I do have two young daughters, and I can see the value of these services. I just wish that everyone in this country could have access to the same services that we have access to. I thank you for your leadership and for the opportunity to address the House tonight. Mr. ALTMIRE. (IMPROVING HEAD START ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 02, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Ohio for his leadership on this issue, and I rise in strong support of this amendment. I am happy to lend my name to it, because this amendment simply says that rural communities which have distinct needs in Head Start programs will now have a level playing field with the changes that have been made under H.R. 1429, which I strongly support.    This bill builds on Head Start's proven success in a way that is going to benefit parents and teachers who are involved in the program. We want to ensure through this amendment that those successes carry forward into rural communities, specifically as it relates to professional development, parental involvement, home visits and health screenings.    So I am pleased to lend my name to this. It is a great amendment, and I thank the gentleman from Ohio for his leadership. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - January 31, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, I did want to talk for just a moment about how important it is that veterans were taken care of in this continuing resolution.    I do want to commend Speaker Pelosi, Chairman Obey, and the rest of the Democratic leadership who did a great job of putting together what was a mess that was left to us.    As Mr. Ryan talked about, we had nine out of eleven appropriations bills to fund this Government that were left in our lap, and we had to deal with that, and we had some tough decisions to make. But under the leadership of Speaker Pelosi and Chairman Obey we did what needed to be done.    I made clear to the leadership, and they agreed, that we needed to make sure that nobody should stand in front of our veterans when it comes time to pass funding resolutions. We have people fighting for us in the field overseas right now. We have veterans coming back from Iraq and, of course, veterans of every age.    That need does not go away. That need does not stop. As the Congressional Budget Office has indicated, the cost of caring for those veterans goes up year after year; and we have an obligation and a duty as Members of Congress to make sure that the VA health care budget goes up enough to maintain the current level of services for every veteran that walks through the door. I want to commend Chairman Obey for taking care of that under this continuing resolution.    I also wanted to just take a walk down memory lane and let's take a look at what the Republican leadership did for veterans' health care over the past several years.    I have a chart here. It might be difficult for some to read.    January, 2003, the Bush administration cut veterans' health care for 164,000 veterans; and that is just the start.    March, 2003, 2 months later, the Republican budget that passed this Congress cut $14 billion from veterans' health care.    March, 2004, 1 year later, the Republican budget shortchanged veterans' health care by an additional $1 1/2 billion.    March, 2005, the following year, President Bush's budget shortchanged veterans' health care by another $2 billion and cut veterans' benefits by $14 billion over 5 years. That is what we were left with.    Now, in the summer of 2005, after they had been warned when they passed that budget back in 2004 and after enormous pressure from the Democrats and from people around this country and especially from veterans' organizations, the Bush administration finally did acknowledge that they shortchanged the veterans; and they added back $2.7 billion after months of Democratic pressure to put that money back in.    But then only a few months later, in March, 2006, President Bush's budget cut veterans' funding by an additional $6 billion over 5 years.    Mr. Speaker, that is the mess that we were left with, this continuing resolution, and that was what needed to be resolved. And I said throughout my campaign and I say every weekend when I go back and speak to these veterans' groups that we are, as a Congress, going to make a new commitment to our veterans, a commitment that has not been there for the past 12 years; and we are going to put veterans' interests first when it comes time to deal with these funding resolutions.    So what did we do? In this continuing resolution that passed this House today, the Democrats increased the VA health care budget by $3.6 billion. Now that is in an atmosphere of having left nine spending bills completely undone, and the Republican leadership made no effort to increase that funding. But we found the will, as Democrats, and we added $3.6 billion to the veterans' budget.    That is leadership; and for that I commend Speaker Pelosi, Chairman Obey and the rest of the Democratic leaders who were involved in putting that together. That is what we have done here today.    So, at this point, I am going to yield to the gentleman from Ohio so he can continue to run the show. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - January 31, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. And I did want to follow up on what the gentlelady from Florida had talked about earlier, what was left to us, and the reason that it was left to us. This was a politically, cowardly maneuver, calculated to gamble on the outcome of the elections. They left nine spending bills unfinished, hoping that they would then win and come back for a lame duck session where they could ram through further spending increases and increase the  Federal budget deficit even more, as they have done every year for the past 6 years. Instead, the results of the election were not to their liking.    The Democrats are retaking control of Congress at that point, and they made a calculated decision. Instead of finishing the work that their constituents sent them here to do, they, instead, dropped the ball and left all nine spending bills until the new year and the new Congress, and countless programs languishing, twisting in the wind while the new change in Congress came.    And again, under the leadership of the new Democrats who have taken control of Congress, we were able to pass, within a month, nine appropriation bills that they couldn't pass over the course of an entire year.    So I can't say enough about the work that this House has done and that this Congress has done in putting together a package that was very, very difficult to do, and it is just a great accomplishment.    Mr. Meek has joined us. I would ask, does the gentleman wish to comment on this? Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - January 31, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I have a question. Does the gentleman know off the top of his head, with the major legislation that we passed in the 100 hours and what we have done subsequent to that, including the continuing resolution, approximately how many Republicans we have seen cross the aisle and join us in a bipartisan manner? Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - January 31, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. And then today 57 more, as the gentleman said. I didn't mean to put the gentleman on the spot, but I wanted to just reemphasize the point that he was making that this is not a partisan majority ramming it down the throat of the Republicans. This is working in a bipartisan spirit, something that has not been seen in this Congress for more than 12 years. And here we are, the end of our first month in office, we passed another major piece of legislation joined by 57 Members on the other side. And the gentleman is right that this is something that we should be applauding. And this is new to Congress. This is not something that has happened recently.    So I would hate for people on the other side during the debate to characterize this as a partisan bill and a partisan effort. It is not. We again, with an average of 62 Republicans, 57 again today, have done this in a bipartisan way, crafting it so that all sides can support it, because we all agree that we need to do things that are to the betterment of the American people and to the benefit of the American people.    I would yield again to the gentleman from Florida to continue, but I did want to just reemphasize that point. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - January 31, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. You are right. Those are the two things that we did the very first couple of days, right after we swore in that new class of freshmen and Democrats took control of Congress. We did away with the gifts and travel and the golf outings and the meals that had been so pervasive in Congress over the past several years.    More importantly to what we are talking about tonight, we reinstituted the PAYGO budget scoring system. And for those Members who talk to their constituents at home, it is what they do in their home kitchens at the end of month. It is what we do when we have to balance our own budgets. You have to have money on one side of the ledger to pay for what goes out on the other side. It is a very simple concept.    Unfortunately, this Congress right after this President took office decided to let that expire. That was required in Congresses past. But, unfortunately, this administration had other ideas; and so they ran up mountains of debt because they were no longer required to have money on the other side of the ledger when they wanted to continue their free-spending ways.    The result was when President Bush first took office he inherited 4 consecutive years of budget surpluses that were forecast to continue as far as the eye could see. In fact, the 10-year budget projection was $5.3 trillion, trillion, with a ``T,'' in surplus over the 10-year period from 2001 to 2010.    Well, what has happened since then? They allowed pay-as-you-go to expire. They have run up the deficit, $3.5 trillion of debt over the past 6 years. The President next week is going to submit to us his budget for fiscal year 2008. It is going to be his seventh consecutive out-of-balance budget. Those deficits continue as far as the eye can see.    What we did in the first week when Democrats took control of Congress, we said, enough is enough. This must stop. We instituted the PAYGO scoring system, which is what turned the record deficits of the 1980s into the record surpluses that we had in the 1990s.    Now that led us to have to make some very difficult decisions in the continuing resolution that we passed today, but we have done it. We have done the hard work. We have talked about the increases that were included in the bill and the funding for veterans and for Pell Grants and for the new expanded health centers that are going to serve 1.2 million patients around the country.    But I do want to make clear to everybody that this measure also includes more than 60 different program cuts to help pay for that, to help balance that situation.        So those 60 programs were reduced below fiscal year 2006 funding proposals, and that provided the $10 billion in savings that we needed to offset those increases that we made in veterans health care and the other programs that we talked about. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - January 31, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I appreciate the gentleman from Connecticut alerting me to that.    For the Members who would like to tell the constituents how they can learn something more about the 30 Something Working Group, I would encourage them to e-mail us at 30somethingdems@mail.house.gov or they can visit the Web site at www.speaker.gov/30something. Mr. ALTMIRE. (REPUBLICANS ARE STILL JUST TALKING -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, for 6 years, the Republicans had control of Congress and of the White House, and for 6 years, the American people waited for them to do something to end our dependence on foreign oil, but despite their constant cry of ``drill, baby, drill,'' the Republicans didn't act on this issue when they had control, and 2 years ago, the American people voted for new leadership in Congress.    Well, yesterday, that new leadership--the Democrats in this House--answered the call by passing a landmark energy bill that triples the available territory for offshore drilling. Let me repeat that. The bill we passed yesterday triples the amount of territory in the Outer Continental Shelf that is available for drilling.    Predictably, many in the minority demonstrated by their votes that they're more interested in having a political issue for the coming election than they are in actually solving the problem. While Democrats have taken decisive action by passing a comprehensive energy bill that includes an unprecedented expansion of offshore drilling, Republicans, as you will hear today, are still just talking. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr Speaker, we are here tonight as part of the 30-Something Working Group. We will be joined tonight by several members of the working group, including Congressman TIM RYAN from Ohio. I believe Congressman Meek from Florida is going to be making an appearance, and anyone else who wants to join in that may be viewing us, certainly from their offices, is welcome to come down and join the discussion on a couple of issues that are facing this country and some things that are in the news this week and that we have dealt with in Congress this week.    Number one, I am going to start with the economy. I don't think anyone can pick up a newspaper, watch a TV or do any reading of any kind without seeing that our economy is in crisis right now. The stock market on this day went down 450 points after going down more than 500 points the day before yesterday.    We are in the position right now, as a Congress, and as a Nation, where we have some very difficult decisions to make. The administration came in and did their third major bailout of a major corporate institution this week with the AIG Insurance Company, and we are going to talk more about that. We are going to talk about the reasons why we got to where we are today.    There is an instructive part of this whole thing to take a walk down memory lane and to see what the economy was like 8 years ago and what the economy is like today, and to discuss how we got from where we are, where we were then, to where we are today.    We also have to talk about what's happening today, what is the crisis, what, exactly, is next. In some ways we don't know, but there are things that  we can do immediately to take immediate action to prevent this crisis from getting worse.    We are going to have a discussion about how we got here. We are going to have a discussion about what we do now. That might be the most important part. There is urgency to this.    Then we are going to talk about the future. What are the long-term safeguards that we can put in place to make sure that this never happens again?    That's, for many onlookers, the worst part of this whole process, the fact that we had safeguards in the market that were supposed to work, that were supposed to prevent this from happening, and those safeguards didn't work. Then, as it applies to the securities industry and some of the leveraging that was taking place in the market, we have the fact that it was a completely unregulated market.    It was a free-for-all, and it wasn't that there was deregulation that took place, in many cases these were markets that were never regulated to begin with. It was a laissez-faire attitude that this administration had, and the free-for-all that took place that led us to where we are today and how are we going to fix that, moving forward into the future.    So with regard to the economy, those are the three things we are going to do, talk about the mistakes that were made in the past that led us to where we are today, talk about what this Congress is going to do, hopefully in a bipartisan way, working with the administration, because there is nothing more important than getting this crisis solved. What are we going to do in the near term to solve the problem and move forward? Then, what are we going to do to ever prevent this from happening again.    To begin that discussion, I would ask the participants in the debate to take a walk down memory lane with me while we talk about where the stock market was 8 years ago. I think that now, now that we are in the crisis we are in, it's fair to compare periods of time. Let's compare the past 8 years to the previous 8 years.    In the 8 years of the Clinton administration, the stock market in this country went up 226 percent, 226 percent increase in 8 years. Now, what is that by the historical average? You say, I don't know, is that a lot, is that a little? What is 226 percent?    Well, the historical average is an increase every year of 11 percent in the stock market, and that's the historical trend. It doesn't matter if you have a Republican president and a Democratic Congress, a Democratic president and a Republican Congress, both chambers represented by the same party, regardless of that, over time, no matter who is in control of the White House and the Congress, the average annual increase in the stock market is approximately 11 percent. In the 8 years in the 1990s, and the economic policies that we conducted in the 1990s, we had a 226 percent increase over 8 years. Pretty good.    What's happened over the past 8 years, because we have had a dramatic shift in our economic policies over the past 8 years. We are going to talk about what some of those policies were. That's part of the subject matter that is at hand with the Presidential race, the fact that we have two candidates with very different views on the economy.    One of them, Senator McCain, has been a part of Congress for 26 years, was involved in the economic policies of the past and wants to continue the policies of the past 8 years into the future. Let's talk about what were the policies of the past 8 years, and what was the impact? We are talking about the stock market.    Well, the stock market today is almost exactly where it was 8 years ago. It's flat lined. It's gone up less than 1 percent. Now that's not 1 percent a year over 8 years, Mr. Speaker, that's less than 1 percent total over the course of the entire 8 years.    The previous 8 years the stock market went up 226 percent. The next 8 years, the current administration's time in office, it's gone up less than 1 percent total over that entire period of time.    It does not look like things are going very well moving towards the future. Hopefully that will correct itself, and we will see some gain in the stock market moving forward.    The point is, the decisions that are made by this Congress, and the decisions that are made by whatever administration is in power, do have a very real impact on our economy. They make a difference.    When you look at the fact that we have had 8 straight months of job losses, this administration, over the 8 years, is going to have the worst record of job creation of any presidential administration since Herbert Hoover. That's not a good record, 8 straight months of job losses. It does not look encouraging for the next several months. But it is the worst record of job creation over an 8-year period for any administration since Herbert Hoover's administration, and we all know what happened there. That's not good.    Our financial industry is in crisis. It's in melt-down mode. Now we can turn that around. We can take steps, working as a Congress and working with the administration to turn it around, and we are going to make the difficult decisions that need to be made to put our house in order and get moving in the right direction.    But when you look at what the mistakes were to get us to where we are today, let's take a look at the national debt, same deal. We will compare the previous 8 years to the current 8-year's administration, and I think that's a fair comparison.    When President Clinton left office, we had just had 4 consecutive years of budget surpluses. Those surpluses were forecast as far as the eye can see.    The Congressional Budget Office, which is an entity which scores over a period of years what the expected surplus is going to be, predicted that over the next 10 years, beginning in 2001 through 2010, we would have a surplus of more than $5.5 trillion.    I would ask the participants that are here tonight, and anyone who might be paying attention to this debate tonight, to think about what the discussion was in the presidential election of 2000. We are a little less than 7 weeks away from a major election here in this country, presidential election, and you see what the debate is about.    In the 2,000 debate between then Governor Bush and then Vice President Gore, the discussion was what are we going to do with this enormous surplus? We are awash in cash. We have a $5.5 trillion projected surplus over what were then the next 10 years. And we've just had 4 consecutive years of budget surplus. So the discussion was, are we going to pay down the debt? Are we going to shore up Social Security?    What are we going to do with this money? Imagine what we could have done. We have had a debate on energy over the past several months, culminating with a vote last night in this House. What could we have done in the past 8 years with $5 trillion if we had chosen to dedicate that money to finding an alternative source of energy, getting us off of our dependence on foreign oil?        There are any number of things that we could have used that surplus for. We could have nearly paid down the entire national debt. One of the largest line items in the Federal budget today is interest on the national debt, $240 billion for 1 year. What could we do with $240 billion if we had paid down the national debt and didn't have that line item in the budget?    Well, that was 8 years ago. We are not having that discussion anymore because instead of those four straight budget surpluses we had at the end of the Clinton administration, we have had eight consecutive budget deficits. And the parting gift that President Bush is going to leave to this country as he leaves office is the largest single-year budget deficit in this Nation's history, more than $480 billion for 1 year.    So we didn't have the $5.5 trillion surplus. No, we had a $4 trillion debt over the course of 8 years and counting, unfortunately, because now, instead of surpluses with no end in sight, we have deficits and debt with no end in sight because of the economic policies that have been conducted over the past 8 years.    Part of the problem, among many problems that have developed with these policies, is the turmoil you are seeing in the market right now, is the stock market, the low U.S. dollar, which one of our previous speakers was  talking about. We are going to get to that.    I have talked about this before, and my colleagues in the 30-Somethings have heard me mention this before. If you had said to an economist as President Bush was taking the oath of office, ``We are expecting a $5.5 trillion surplus, but what would we need to do to have a $9 trillion swing from positive to negative in the debt? What would have to happen?'' That is going from $5 trillion in the positive to $4 trillion in the negative, a $9 trillion swing. If you asked what would we have to do from an economic perspective if we were trying to have a $9 trillion swing, what type of policies, well, any economist that you asked would have said that is impossible. You couldn't possibly mismanage the economy to such an extent you are going to have a $9 trillion swing. Well, unfortunately, we have.    Now, I know there are those who will say, well, it wasn't the administration in the 1990s that were responsible for the enormous surpluses, it was the Republican Congress. And people who look at history might say it was President Bush the First who put into place pay-as-you-go budget scoring. And pay-as-you-go budget scoring is one of the factors that led to the record surpluses we had in the 1990s in contrast to the record deficits we had in the 1980s.    Unfortunately, one of the things that one of the previous Congresses did right after President Bush took office was to do away with pay-as-you-go. What is pay-as-you-go? Pay-as-you-go budget scoring is what we do in our home checkbooks, what every American does in their bank accounts, and what every business in America does with their balance sheet. It is very simple. You have to have money on one side of the ledger if you want to spend it on the other.    Unfortunately, we did away with that in this country after the 2001 turn of the administration, and that has led to decisions being made where nothing had to be paid for, just charge it to the credit card. Whatever spending you want to do, don't worry, we don't have to have an offset anymore because we don't have pay-as-you-go. So if you want to increase spending, put it on the credit card; somebody will take care of it.    The problem is that eventually the bill comes due. This leads me to where we are today; the bill has come due. Anyone who has seen what happened with Wall Street over the past several months and certainly over the past few days can see that the bill has come due. And, unfortunately, it is the American taxpayer that is now going to have to pick up the bill.    And because of the decisions that have been made to bail out the corporate executives and the big Wall Street financiers instead of middle-class Americans, it is middle-class families in this country that are going to have to pay the bill. It is middle-class families in this country that are going to get that bill in the mail while we are bailing out the big corporate executives.    We are going to continue that discussion, but rather than give a monologue, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ryan) is here, and I would like to welcome him to the discussion and yield to him. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. The gentleman sets me up perfectly because that is exactly the point I was going to try to make. When the gentleman from Ohio was talking about the policies of the past Congress and this administration and things like the energy bill of 2005, we have empirical evidence, what is the result when this Congress took action, passed, sent to the President and was signed into law? Well, gas prices skyrocketed, dramatically increased our dependence on foreign oil.     So what is the impact on our economy by the economic policies that were carried out under this administration? You could not have more of a stark contrast in evidence, the way that the economy boomed in the 1990s and what we are seeing here in the last 8 years.    As I mentioned earlier, the economy over the past 8 years is driven by the stock market, and the stock market is up less than 1 percent over 8 years, almost exactly today where it was 8 years ago.    The point I was going to make is we can lament, as the gentleman and I have done many times, the policies of the past and look for ways that we can solve the problem moving forward. But let's not forget a crisis that was averted by the American people, a policy that was thankfully not carried out.    This President, in the previous 6 years in Congress before the new session came in, tried desperately to privatize Social Security. President Bush, you'll remember, around 2004, 2005, and Vice President Cheney traveled all around the country with their dog-and-pony show and charts and graphs talking about Social Security, privatizing Social Security, putting some of the money that is supposed to go, as it has always gone, into the pockets of senior citizens and instead putting that in the private market.    We already have ways to invest in the private market, and we certainly encourage people to do that. And one of the things that we are going to do moving forward is figure out a way to further incentivize private savings through 401(k)s and IRAs and all the rest. The point is that is not what Social Security is for.    If there was ever any doubt that was a good idea, and the American people certainly cast judgment upon that, imagine, I would ask my colleagues when they go back home and talk to their constituents, imagine if you had to retire and you reached the age at which you were going to start to claim Social Security at some point in the past 8 years.    If you were retiring in 2000 and that stock market had just gone up 226 percent over the past 8 years, boy, that was a great deal. That was quite an investment. It would have worked out just fine for you. But if you are one of the millions of Americans who would have qualified for retirement age in the past 8 years, maybe that wasn't such a good idea after all. You wouldn't have even got a cost-of-living adjustment. You would have flat-lined.        And that's certainly unacceptable with our Social Security.    I would yield to the gentleman from Ohio. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. It's worth mentioning, both of the gentlemen, I'm sure, remember, early in this session of Congress, in the beginning of 2007, we wanted to work with President Bush on a way to stabilize and shore up Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. We, as a Congress, went to the administration and said, look, there's going to be trouble down the road if we don't take action. Will you work with us on that? And President Bush said, no, I'm not interested in that and I won't support that. So away we went.    And then we came to the beginning of 2008, the economy starting to take a dramatic turn for the worse, so working together in fairness, in a bipartisan way, the House and Senate, with the administration, Republican and Democrat alike, and we put together very quickly a stimulus package to put money immediately in the hands of people who needed it, who were going to put it into the economy, get the economy jump-started, and it worked. If you look at the second quarter, we had an up tick in the economy because of the work that this Congress did.    Well, part of the stimulus that was not included, we, again, went to the administration and said, you know what? Can we revisit that issue that we asked you about a year ago? Can we revisit the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac issue, because we really see trouble on the way here if we don't act. Again we were told, well, we're not interested in including that in the stimulus.    And guess what happened?    Now there's a multibillion-dollar bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that's taken place. The government actually had to come in and take over those two GSEs. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. The gentleman reminds me of a point, which I meant to bring up, that I'm amused when I hear the discussion about, is John McCain's economic policy identical to George Bush's economic policy? Is he a third term of George Bush?    The fact is, readers of history will know, actually, if you go back and look at the economic policies of Warren Harding and Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover, you'll find a lot of similarities in what happened over the previous 8 years, the mistakes that were made with the lack of regulation.    I talked earlier that it wasn't, for the most part, deregulation. It was non-regulation. We didn't take regulation away that existed. There was just never any regulation at all; very similar to what took place in the 1920s, leading up to the calamity of the Great Depression.    So I would ask readers of history and people who are interested in this subject, compare the economic policies that have led us to where we are today through President Bush and what Senator McCain is proposing to those three presidents I mentioned.    And I would just say, before I transfer to Mr. Murphy from Connecticut, or Mr. Ryan, if you wanted to comment, but I get asked a lot recently, about bailouts of these three big companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and then AIG and Bear Stearns before; and what's the reason that we picked those while we let Lehman Brothers go under, and who's minding the store here, and why are these decisions being made, and who's next. What's the next shoe to drop is what you hear.    This is a systemic problem. This is not a problem with individual financiers. This is not a problem that Bear Stearns had all on their own or AIG had all on their own or Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. This is a system-wide problem that needs to be dealt with, and we can't continue to take a piecemeal approach and decide on a day-by-day basis who survives and who doesn't.    Well, Lehman Brothers, you can go under. We're sorry. But today we're going to bail out AIG, the next day.    We can't continue down that road. We have to address the systemic root of the problem to prevent this from happening. The first thing is to stabilize.    I'll go to Mr. Perlmutter, and then we'll go to Mr. Murphy from Connecticut. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. And when I go back to western Pennsylvania and they hear the word ``regulation,'' small businesses and families, they get a little nervous, rightly, because in a lot of ways we are over-regulated in this country.    And I want to just, before we close here, I want to make sure everybody understands what we're talking about. We're not talking about the small businesses. We're not talking about the small corner bank. We're talking about the huge Wall Street financier, the conglomerates, these people who are getting the $30 billion golden parachutes when the CEO gets canned.    The small businesses in this country, the reason you're having trouble in the credit market right now, the reason you may not be able to get loans for capital development and whatever else it is that you're working on is because the intra-bank lending, the staple of our economy, bank-to-bank lending, is frozen. The credit market is in crisis and it's frozen, and that's affecting small businesses. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. That's exactly what I want to clarify, and I thank the gentleman.    We're talking about asking the big Wall Street firms to comply with the same rules and regulations that the small business, that the corner banks have to comply with. Now, it's not exactly the same, and we understand that. But I understand the fear that it strikes in the heart of ordinary Americans when we start talking about the word ``regulation.'' We are not talking about everyday Americans. We're talking about what happens at the absolute top of the food chain.    These large banks and institutions that you see right now that are teetering on the brink, the Lehman Brothers of the world that are no longer part of the process now, and the ones that we have to come in and bail out with an $85 billion bailout at taxpayer expense, these are things we want to avoid. So that's what we're talking about. We are not talking about the small businesses and the corner banks. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I thank the gentleman from Colorado.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ryan), I thank Mr. Murphy from Connecticut, and I thank the Speaker for allowing us this time to discuss the economic crisis in this country. I think it's safe to say that this is not the last time the 30-Something Working Group will address this issue on the floor.    And I would also say that I do look forward to my good friend Mr. Westmoreland, who is going to come after us, and I'm sure he's going to have something to say. He sat patiently through the entire hour and listened to us speak, and I know he comes from a different point of view. And I would encourage those interested in this topic to listen to what he has to say as well. We've had many conversations about this and the energy issue and other things. So we look forward to hearing him. Mr. ALTMIRE. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007--VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (H. DOC. NO. 110-62) -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman.    Madam Speaker, today the President showed that he fails to understand the struggle before Pennsylvania's working families when he vetoed a bipartisan, fiscally responsible bill to provide health care to 10 million children, including 320,000 in Pennsylvania, and in justifying his veto, all he offers is the same tired rhetoric, too expensive.    Well, our bill pays for itself at no additional cost to the taxpayer and doesn't add one penny to the Federal deficit.    Socialized medicine? The SCHIP bill continues a State-administered block grant that's delivered in the private market, and the private insurers and the American Medical Association have endorsed this bill.    A subsidy for wealthy families? Well, most children covered live in families that earn less than $40,000 a year, and these are working families that we're talking about, working families that work hard and play by the rules but can't afford health care for their children.    I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join the majorities in both the House and the Senate, the 43 Governors and 68 Senators, and join us in support of this bill.  Mr. ALTMIRE. (DEMOCRATIC ACCOMPLISHMENTS PRIORITIZING THE NEEDS OF VETERANS AND SOLDIERS -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, this Democratic Congress has a strong record of delivering on our promise to the American people and providing real and meaningful change. And we have done so in a fiscally responsible way, instituting pay-as-you-go, deficit reduction discipline.    One area where we have made real progress for the American people is by supporting the men and women who serve our Nation in the Armed Forces. Under Democratic control, this House provided substantially more than the President requested for the new M-  RAP vehicles proven to save lives in Iraq. We voted to give our troops a pay raise that the President called ``unnecessary.'' We strengthened military health care with the Wounded Warriors Act to clean up the inadequate care of wounded soldiers at Walter Reed and other facilities. And the Democratic House voted to provide the largest increase in funding for VA health care in the history of this country.    Mr. Speaker, these investments that support our veterans and troops overseas are just a few examples of how our Democratic Congress is taking America in a new direction. Mr. ALTMIRE. (ISRAEL -- (House of Representatives - September 06, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. It was my first trip to Israel, and I know the gentlewoman from Nevada has been there multiple times, countless times, in fact. For me to have seen firsthand what you are talking about today, there really is nothing like seeing it in person.    When we went to the border, and I know that the gentlewoman has talked about this tonight, we went to the border with Gaza and we looked at Sderot and we had families there that until recently lived in Gaza. The mother of course with the children, she pointed across to where she used to live. She said, ``That used to be my house.'' She told her story about when she is getting her kids ready for school, the alarms will go off and they know that the bombs are starting to come in. She told this gut-wrenching story about her experience in a minivan with her kids getting ready to go to school and the alarm goes off. That really puts it in perspective that these are families that are just trying to get through the day, and this is what they have to deal with, not once as the gentleman from New York said, but repeatedly over and over again. These families have to endure the threat of that stockpile that he is talking about landing in their house, hitting their car and killing members of their family. These are things that we can't comprehend on a daily basis in this country, to have that threat every single day raining down upon you.    As the gentleman from New York described, in many instances these are primitive weapons that we are talking about. But in many instances these are weapons that have rained down on this community by the thousands, literally by the thousands. And we met with a gentleman that one of them had hit his house. Again, when you see firsthand the people that are affected by this and the children that are affected by this, it puts in perspective the fact that they are living right there on the border.    What struck me the most when we asked her the obvious question: Why don't you just move? I think that is what many of us might think about doing. And she said much more articulately than I can say tonight, but she said: ``Look, this is where we live. This is our home. If we move, then we have lost. If we move, they are going to move up to where we happen to be at that moment. Then they will start again and we will have to move again. We are not going to do that. We are going to stay here. This is our home. We are under great threat, but we are not moving.''    That really tells the tale of the type of people, the fortitude that we are talking about.    I had been watching the discussion and I couldn't sit back any longer. I had to tell my piece of the story having seen this firsthand, and what a magnificent thing it is to see the courage and the bravery of these people. But the threat that they live under is something that cannot be ignored. Mr. ALTMIRE. (ISRAEL -- (House of Representatives - September 06, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. That's right. We were touched by the pain, but we were also touched by the courage that they endure daily these attacks, and they stay and they don't have to do that, but they make the decision to be there. And when you see the story and you see the children firsthand, and again, when they point across in the Gaza and say I used to live in that house right there, that used to be my house. Mr. ALTMIRE. (ENSURING CONTINUED ACCESS TO STUDENT LOANS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill that I joined with Chairman Miller in introducing to ensure the current credit crunch does not prevent students from attending college.    Recent decisions to suspend the issuing of student loans by the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency and other lenders around the  country clearly demonstrate the need for this legislation.    This bill is a model for bipartisan cooperation. Problems in the credit market began affecting the student loan market only 2 months ago, and since that time Congress has quickly moved to identify the problem, craft a responsible solution to that problem, and quickly move that solution through the legislative process. And, today, we are sending this bill to the President for his signature.    Congress can be proud of taking this proactive step to prevent a crisis and I am proud of what we did today, and encourage my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. ALTMIRE. (CONGRESSIONAL IMMIGRATION CAUCUS -- (House of Representatives - March 07, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I thank the Speaker for this time, once again allowing us to begin the 30-Something Working Group.    We have a lot of issues to talk about. And as everyone who has followed the 30-Something Working Group over the years knows, this is our attempt to let the American people know what is happening in their Congress and what the issues are that are being discussed, and we have requested some time here to be able to go into some detail on what these issues are. And I wanted to start today by talking about the situation at Walter Reed, which I know is a subject that is of great concern to everybody in this Chamber, and it is certainly the issue that I am hearing the most about as I travel around my district. And if we have some time after we conclude that discussion, we may move on to some other issues.    But I wanted to start by talking about the situation at Walter Reed. And I have put up here for my colleagues to take a look at the Newsweek cover from this week, and we see here that this is a national story. It is the number one story in the country, and it tells the story about how we are, unfortunately in many cases, failing our wounded. You can see it on the cover.    What we are talking about with the situation at Walter Reed is we have brave men and woman who are fighting for this country, who are putting their lives on the line, who are making every possible sacrifice, and they are coming home in need of medical treatment, in many cases serious health situations, long-term medical problems, and we have not seen the best quality of care that those men and women deserve. And the situation that has been uncovered recently at Walter Reed is something that was uncovered by a Washington Post expose'. It wasn't brought to light by the people at Walter Reed, it wasn't brought to light by elected officials, it wasn't brought to light by anyone except for a series of newspaper articles.    There are two issues that we need to discuss. The second of those issues is, why did it take a Washington Post news article before people started to talk about this issue, before people started to be held accountable for this issue? Which, as I am going to talk about in the time line of events, for those of you who may wonder how this  all came about, what were the complaints, how long has this situation been known, we are going to walk through that entire time line tonight. But the second issue is, why did that Washington Post news article become the first source for all of this to happen?    The number one issue that we need to deal with as a Congress and that we can promise the American people that we are going to deal with is we need to find a solution to this problem right now. We understand there is a situation that needs to be resolved. And to be candid, the American people aren't calling for another blue ribbon panel that is going to take a 2-year study and issue a report that is 2 1/2 inches thick and sit on somebody's desk before anything happens. They want results right now.    We need to go into every military and veterans health care facility in this country and make a determination: Are the conditions substandard? Are there actions that need to be taken? And, if so, let's deal with that immediately. Let's not wait for the course of a long-term study. There is going to be room for that and there are going to be people held accountable, and that is not to say that we are not going to work hard to detail every single fact of how this came to be. But the most important part for our military men and women who were promised quality health care when they signed up is we need to restore their confidence and their trust in the system, which right now, justifiably, is lacking. Because we have military men and women every day who are coming back, not just to Walter Reed, but all across this country to Department of Defense facilities, and veterans who have put their lives on the line who are coming back and using the VA health care system and finding that the care in many cases, as has been described with Walter Reed, is substandard. This is outrageous and this is unacceptable, and this Congress is going to take the appropriate action to make sure that these things are taken care of and they do not happen again.    So, again, the two issues: number one, fix the problem now; number two, let's get to the bottom of why it took so long for people to be held accountable and for us to get to the point where this situation was known to the American people and especially to our brave men and women.    So I do have a time line of events that we in the 30-Something Working Group are going to turn into a chart which we will be able to display at one of our future meetings, but now I did just want to read some of these things that have happened in the past.    In mid-to-late 2004, a very senior Member of this Congress, with his wife, announced that he was going to stop visiting Walter Reed out of frustration. He said he had voiced his concerns about what he was seeing to his commanders, including Major General Kiley, over the troubling incidents that he had witnessed. And this, again, is a very senior Member of this Congress, said his efforts were rebuffed and ignored. And he has a quote that says when he brought problems to the attention of Walter Reed, he was made to feel very uncomfortable. Now, that is unacceptable, and that was 2 1/2 years ago. So right there we have a very senior Member of Congress voicing concerns and being ignored.    In November 2005, the Congress was then of course controlled by the Republican Party, and the House Veterans' Affairs Committee announced that, for the first time in at least 55 years, veteran service organizations would no longer have the opportunity to present testimony before a joint hearing of the House and Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee. So in November of 2005, we had an announcement from this Congress, then under Republican control, that we would not be investigating any situations and there would be no forum to bring before Congress complaints about what we were seeing at Walter Reed.    The pattern continues. In September of 2006, 13 Senators sent a letter to the Senate Appropriations Committee to preserve language in the House Defense Appropriations bill that prohibits U.S. Army from outsourcing 350 Federal jobs at Walter Reed Medical Center. This is September of 2006. A similar provision was defeated by a close vote in the Senate of 50-48 during the bill's previous consideration.    Also in September of 2006, and again for my colleagues watching we are going to have a chart that will illustrate this and it be visible. But in September of 2006, Walter Reed awards a 5-year, $120 million contract to IAP Worldwide Services, which is run by a former senior Halliburton official, to replace a staff of 300 Federal employees. So those employees were replaced in September of 2006, despite the fact there had been to that point complaints by very senior Members of Congress about what was happening at Walter Reed.        I would pause there to ask my colleague from Connecticut, Mr. Murphy, if he is ready to weigh in on this issue. And if not, I can certainly continue down the time line. Mr. ALTMIRE. (CONGRESSIONAL IMMIGRATION CAUCUS -- (House of Representatives - March 07, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Thank you, Mr. Murphy. And I wanted to, before getting into some of the quotes that the men and women who have been in Walter Reed have, over the course of time provided, I did want to continue down the time line. And I had left off with the 5-year, $120 million contract that was awarded to a former Halliburton official which led to the replacement of 300 employees at Walter Reed.     And I wanted to, then, quote from a New York Times article about that issue. It said: ``The prospect of privatization at Walter Reed led to a large exodus of skilled personnel after the Army reversed results, actually changed the results of an audit conducted that government employees could do the job more cheaply.''    So they had done a study that showed that things could be done in that manner. But they decided to reverse the results and move in the direction that we have described. And we have, unfortunately, seen the results.    I will move in, now, to some of the quotes. And it is troubling, I will tell my colleagues who are watching, to hear some of the complaints that were made. And I would remind, again, that in 2005, the Republican leadership of this Congress made a decision that they were going to not hold the joint hearings on this issue to allow some of these things to be brought to the attention, not only of the Congress, but of the American people. And it is unfortunate what the result has been, that 2 years went by and these things continued, and these quotes are the result.    And I am going to refer my colleagues to this chart as I am reading: ``The mold, mice and rot at Walter Reed's Building 18 compose a familiar scenario for many soldiers back from Iraq or Afghanistan. Soldiers and veterans at other facilities report bureaucratic disarray similar to Walter Reed's. Indifferent, untrained staff, lost paperwork, medical appointments that drop from the computers, and long waits for consultations.''    And what this describes, unfortunately, is that the problem at Walter Reed is not unique to Walter Reed, but it is a systemic problem across the country's military and Veterans Affairs facilities. And that is very troubling to me.    I have three VA hospitals in western Pennsylvania, one of which is in my district. And it is undergoing a $200 million renovation right now. And I am hopeful that we will, at that time, have the premiere Veterans Affairs highest-quality facility in the entire country.    But the systemic problem facing our military health facilities and our Veterans Affairs facilities is shown by some of these quotes. So, again, my colleagues want to refer to this chart. From California, this says: ``The room was swarming with fruit flies, trash was overflowing, and a syringe was lying on the table.'' That is from a facility in California.    From a facility in Fort Knox, Kentucky: ``The living conditions were the worst I had ever seen for soldiers. Paint peeling, mold, windows that didn't work. I went to the hospital chaplain to get them to issue blankets and linens. There were no nurses.''    So as troubling as the situation at Walter Reed is for those of us who are now delving into the details and learning the unfortunate facts, it is even more troubling to think that these are problems that are happening all across this country. Mr. ALTMIRE. (CONGRESSIONAL IMMIGRATION CAUCUS -- (House of Representatives - March 07, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Well, the level of frustration I think that we are all feeling builds every day as more of these facts come out. And I think the most upsetting part is the fact that these are situations that were known within the military health apparatus, and nothing was done about it.    Complaints were made from patients. Complaints were made from families. Complaints were made, as I talked about earlier, not just from Members of Congress, but from very senior and influential Members of Congress, all of which were ignored.    And continuing with our around-the-country look at some other things that have happened, if my colleagues could refer to this chart.        This comes from Fort Campbell in Kentucky where they said: ``There were yellow signs on the door stating that our barracks had asbestos.'' This was an open and operating military facility.    From Fort Irwin in California: ``Most of us had to sign waivers where we understand that the housing we were in failed to meet minimal government standards.''    It is very troubling for me, and I am sure for my colleagues listening, to read and to hear these quotes and think of the fact that there is no group of people that should stand ahead of our men and women in the military and our military veterans when it comes time to allocate Federal resources. And we have a Federal budget that is approaching $3 trillion, and we certainly spend a lot of that on the Defense, and rightly so, Department of Defense. And to hear these situations taking place, it is just very upsetting.    So, continuing, for my colleagues, to refer to the chart again: ``Behind the door of Army Specialist Jeremy Duncan's room, part of the wall is torn and hangs in the air, weighted down with black mold. When the wounded combat engineer stands in his shower and looks up, he can see the bathtub on the floor above through a rotted hole. Signs of neglect are everywhere. Mouse droppings, belly-up cockroaches, stained carpets, cheap mattresses.''    And I will move to the last chart we have with these quotes, and then we can discuss it a little further. This is from building 18, which is the subject of the Washington Post report on Walter Reed which began this whole investigation: ``Life in building 18 is the bleakest homecoming for men and women whose government promised them good care in return for their sacrifices. `I hate it,' said one soldier, who stays in his room all day. `There are cockroaches. The elevator doesn't work. The garage door doesn't work. Sometimes there is no heat, no water.' ''    Well, I do want to assure my colleagues and the American people and reiterate what I said earlier that by far the more important thing here is fixing the problem. We have outlined, I think, in pretty graphic detail what the problem is and the scope of the problem. We are not just talking about one facility at Walter Reed, although that has been the source of the beginning of this story. We are talking about facilities all across this country. And we do need a top-to-bottom review of every single facility. Let us find every problem that exists and let us fix it right now. That is the number one issue.    And we are not as interested in casting blame in this situation. There is no question people need to be held accountable for this problem. And the hearings that we have had and the hearings that this Congress is going to continue to have with the Armed Services Committee, with the Veterans' Affairs Committee and with the Government Oversight Committee, we are going to get to the bottom of how this could possibly have happened, why it happened, who is responsible and who should be held accountable. But, again, that is the secondary issue. The primary issue is fixing the problem now. And I want to assure the American people, as I am sure my friend Mr.  Murphy does, that this timeline that I was reading from is going to stop in March 2007, as far as the situation being ignored and the situation not being brought to light. This is a new day. It is a new Congress. And we are going to take action. And it is unfortunate, and I am regretful that it took this long. But we are here now, and the situation that we are describing is not going to be easy, but we have a commitment in this Congress for Members like Mr. Murphy and myself that place no greater priority than finding the resolution to this problem and to our Nation's military men and women. Mr. ALTMIRE. (CONGRESSIONAL IMMIGRATION CAUCUS -- (House of Representatives - March 07, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. You talked about investments, making investments in our troops and making investments in our veterans. As you know on this 30-Something Working Group, I have spent a lot of time talking about our Nation's veterans and our VA healthcare system, and I am going to spend a lot more time talking about our VA healthcare system, because, as I said, there is no group that should stand ahead of our Nation's veterans when it comes time to make funding decisions.    I wanted to talk a little bit about the decisions that have been made in past years. We have talked about this before, and I have another chart here that I would like my colleagues to take a look at. This is the underfunding, the chronic underfunding of the VA healthcare system.    We have talked before about the fact that President Bush has delivered seven State of the Union addresses now and he has only mentioned veterans healthcare in one of those seven State of the Union addresses.    I think as a Congress we have a responsibility when we talk about supporting our troops and we talk about supporting the brave men and women who we are sending off to battle, who were promised quality healthcare in  the VA health system when they signed up, we have an obligation to fund all of them at levels at which they can obtain this quality healthcare.    So let's take a look at what has happened in recent years. I refer to the chart.    In January of 2003, President Bush's budget cut veterans healthcare and eliminated 164,000 veterans from the roles of eligibility for VA healthcare. That was in January of 2003.    In March of that same year, this Congress's budget, the Republican budget that cut $14 billion from veterans healthcare, passed. 199 Democrats voted against it in this Chamber, but, unfortunately, at that point the Democrats were in the minority and they couldn't prevent these cuts. We have seen what the result has been of that $14 billion cut.    In March of 2004, the Republican budget that shortchanged veterans healthcare by an additional $1.5 billion passed Congress, and this time 201 Democrats voted against it. But, again, being in the minority, Democrats were unable to prevent those cuts, and we have seen the result.    In March of 2005, continuing, President Bush's budget shortchanged veterans healthcare by an additional $2 billion for 2005 and cut VA healthcare by $14 billion over the next 5 years. 201 Democrats voted against that.    So I think, Mr. Murphy, you would agree that you see a trend developing here over time of just cut after cut after cut to the VA healthcare system, and that is, A, not fair and not just, but it is also not sustainable, without encountering the types of problems and the systemic difficulties that we are seeing across the VA healthcare system.    So in the summer of 2005, after serious Democratic pressure, months and months of pressure and warnings that the shortfall was going to be detrimental to the VA, the Bush administration finally acknowledged that their previous budgets had been inadequate and the shortfall had been $2.7 billion. The Democrats fought all summer to get this resolved. It is a disgrace that it had to come to that. We never should have been in that position.    Then, after months and months of this discussion, in March of 2006, almost a year earlier from today, President Bush's budget cut veterans funding by an additional $6 billion over 5 years. Keep in mind, this is in the context of not mentioning veterans in his State of the Union addresses when he comes before this Chamber and outlines to us what his priorities are within his budget for the coming year. Veterans are not even mentioned. And I can see why. I wouldn't mention it either, if I had the same type of record on veterans healthcare as the President has. So in March of last year he proposed $6 billion in cuts over 5 years.    Well, something happened in November of 2006. As we all know, the American people spoke up and said they were fed up with this and weren't going to take it any more. I know I heard loud and clear throughout my campaign and certainly on that election day in November that veterans funding was a big part of why the American people were frustrated with the decisions of this administration and the decisions of this Congress up to that time.    As we have talked about many times, I said that my number one priority in considering the budget for the current year, which was left undone by the previous Congress, was veterans healthcare funding. I said I would never support a budget that did not at least maintain the current level of services for VA healthcare funding in the continuing years, and certainly in the current year.    Thankfully, under the new leadership in Congress we passed a budget for fiscal year 2007 that increased veterans funding by $3.6 billion. I won't go back and read the numbers again, but you remember hearing about a lot of billions of dollars of decreases, $14 billion over 5 years, $6 billion additionally over 5 years in previous Congresses.    The first budget we had to pass in this Congress, in the climate of enormous pressure for fiscal responsibility, we had to cut over 60 programs to find the room in the new pay-as-you-go budget scoring to pay for this, because we are not running the country on a credit card as we have in years past. We are fiscally responsible and we do have an obligation to find the funding to pay for our priorities. And we did that. We found $3.6 billion to increase funding for veterans healthcare.    I think in the time to come, very shortly you are going to see a further demonstration, a very strong demonstration from this Congress in a very difficult climate of our commitment to funding VA healthcare. That is going to be something that we are able to demonstrate to the American people, and to keep our promise to do what we said we were going to do and to do what the American people expected us to do.    But the unfortunate reality, Mr. Murphy, is that these funding cuts from the past have had a terrible effect on the institutions, both in the VA and also the lack of attention in the Department of Defense health facilities, and has led to some very, very serious problems, as outlined by the Washington Post. But those issues have consequences, and they are in the past. We have a responsibility now in the new Congress as leaders and as the elected group from the American people that is charged with dealing with this to take action. As we have said many times tonight, we are going to take action.     Mr. ALTMIRE. (CONGRESSIONAL IMMIGRATION CAUCUS -- (House of Representatives - March 07, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I appreciate the gentleman mentioning that.    I wanted to finish the time line. I want to make sure to get that in before we run out of time here, and then maybe move on to one other issue.    In September 2006, we talked about the replacement of the 300 employees by the former Halliburton official.    In October 2006, the Secretary of Defense's wife, Joyce Rumsfeld, the then-Secretary of Defense, was taken to Walter Reed by a close friend who was also a Walter Reed volunteer. When hospital officials found out that this was the case, Mrs. Rumsfeld's friend was banned from entering or continuing to volunteer at the hospital.    So the implication was they did not want them to see what was happening at the hospital. That is from a Washington Post article. I would not have mentioned that were it not printed in the Washington Post, that the Secretary of Defense's wife had a close friend volunteering at Walter Reed, and they were asked not to continue volunteering, again the implication that they would not like what they would be seeing there.    Then, moving to February 4, 2007, getting up almost to current time. The number of Federal employees providing facilities management services at Walter Reed by this time, a month ago, had dropped from 300 to fewer than 60. This is before The Washington Post article came out, immediately before. The remaining 60 employees, 50 of them were private workers. That is from the Army Times where we get those statistics.    And then everything begins to change.    February 19, The Washington Post expose comes out detailing mistreatment of veterans and housing on the grounds of Walter Reed Army Medical Center. That is the turning point. Unfortunately, we heard about the 2004 visit and the complaints registered by a senior Member of Congress. We heard, in 2005, the then-Republican Veterans' Affairs Committee chairman announced they were not interested in hearing from our Nation's veterans anymore; they were not welcome to address the committee to talk about some of these issues.    The Washington Post article comes out February 19, one week later, February 26, the soldiers at Walter Reed Army Medical Center were told that they were to wake up at 6 a.m. every morning and have their rooms ready for inspection at 7 a.m. This was new. More importantly, they were told that they were no longer allowed to speak to the media. I think we can see why that is.    So that is the time line of events leading up.    Let's look at what has happened this week. This is Wednesday, March 7.    Well, on March 5, in the new Congress here, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee began holding hearings to investigate the Walter Reed scandal; again, in the context of the previous Congress, that was unwelcome.    March 6 and 7, yesterday and today, the House Veterans' Affairs Committee held hearings on the Walter Reed scandal, and today there was also an Armed Services Committee hearing. So we have three separate committees looking into this, actively reviewing the situation and actively looking for answers and actively looking for results.        So I would refer, once again, anyone interested in learning more about this story to the Newsweek article, and I once again put this chart up. It is a great article. It gives a good summary of the situation, and I would ask the American people and our colleagues to just continue to seek answers. We are going to do our best to get to the bottom of this. We are going to do our best to make sure that this system is resolved, and unless Mr. Murphy wants to talk about this, I was going to, in our short time, move into one other issue because it is budget season. Mr. ALTMIRE. (CONGRESSIONAL IMMIGRATION CAUCUS -- (House of Representatives - March 07, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. That is a chart that we are going to be seeing a lot more of, and I did want to make one point about that.    Those 81 oversight hearings on what is happening in Iraq, those are not make-work hearings. Those are not hearings just to hold hearings. Those are serious issues that this Congress is looking at. Mr. ALTMIRE. (CONGRESSIONAL IMMIGRATION CAUCUS -- (House of Representatives - March 07, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. This is in the context of being told, the American people were told, that the oil proceeds in Iraq would pay for the cost of the war. You have a couple of issues. One is the oil proceeds. We do not have any accounting of where a lot of them are going. They are disappearing into the black market. They are certainly not paying for the cost of the war.    The second issue is, we have paid almost $400 billion as a Nation on the Iraq War of our money, the American people's money, and as you have outlined, we have lost billions of dollars in Iraq that is completely unaccounted for. You certainly know about that from the Government Oversight Committee, and I am sure we will talk more about that.    In just the few minutes that we have remaining, about 4 minutes remaining, I did want to talk about    budget season. Here we are in the spring, and as our loyal constituents and people who follow the 30 Something Working Group will know, we do talk about the budget at some length and rightly so, because the budget has not been managed well over the past 6 years.    We have an administration that came into office. We had just had four consecutive years of budget surpluses that were forecast as far as the eye can see, and in the last 6 years, we have had six consecutive budget deficits that are now forecast as far as the eye can see. There has been a $9 trillion swing in the 10-year forecast from a $5.5 trillion surplus over 10 years to a $3.5 trillion dollar because of the fiscal mismanagement that we have seen over the past 6 years. The President just submitted to us his 2007 out-of-balance budget.    So I will use this as a teaser for perhaps our next 30 Something Working Group because we will not be able to get into it as much as we would like, but for those watching, I would just say that we are going to talk at great length about some of these issues in the coming weeks.    We were going to talk about foreign-held debt today, and I have a chart that I would refer my colleagues to. This President has added more than $1 trillion of foreign-held debt to America's balance in just 6 years. He did more than his 42 predecessors combined in just 6 years. The history of the country up to his administration had put less in foreign-held debt than he did in just 6 years.    So let us take a look at who is holding this debt. I get this question all the time because I talk about the deficit and the debt and who is holding it. Japan holds $644 billion in American debt right now. China holds $350 billion of American debt. That is after only 1 year earlier it was $250 billion. So the Chinese have added $100 billion in American-held debt. The U.K., $240 billion, and you can see the other countries down here, Hong Kong is on there. Of course, they are now part of China. This was a historical chart.    So we have a lot of work to do to restore fiscal responsibility, but we are going to be talking in the weeks ahead in how we are going to do that with this Congress.    We have already taken the steps to move in that direction with the pay-as-you-go budget scoring, and you are going to see some things happening with the budget that have not been done in 6 or 7 years because we do have a responsibility to be fiscally responsible. The American people sent us here to do that.    So with that, I would ask Mr. Murphy if he does not have any comments, he has got his e-mail chart there. Mr. ALTMIRE. (MILITARY RESERVIST AND VETERAN SMALL BUSINESS REAUTHORIZATION AND OPPORTUNITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 05, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I thank the Chair and the ranking member for their continued leadership on these issues, and I especially want to thank my good friend from Florida, Mr. Buchanan. It was a pleasure working with him to craft this legislation. He was an equal partner in putting this bill on the floor today, and I want to recognize his leadership as well.    Madam Speaker, with nearly 25 million veterans and over 1 million Reservists in the United States, there is a need, and a growing need, for an increased commitment by the government to assist veterans and Reservists both during and after their service to our Nation. As more and more servicemembers return to civilian life after their deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan, the opportunities and economic benefits that the Federal Government can provide will become even more critical, especially for businesses that are owned and operated by veterans.    The brave men and women that put their lives on hold to defend our Nation should not have to sacrifice their jobs and their livelihoods. Starting and maintaining a small business presents challenges for anyone, and, unfortunately, veterans often face unique barriers as a result of their military service. The unemployment rate among veterans is double the overall national unemployment rate, and over half of all self-employed Reservists experience significant income loss when they are called to duty.    Over the past 3 years, we have watched as the number of returning veterans and Reservists has increased, and that number is only going to continue to grow.    While Congress has passed legislation and provided Federal agencies with some of the resources necessary to provide entrepreneurial opportunities for veterans, I believe that more can be done to relieve the burden that is placed on small business owners during and after their deployment.    To ensure that the Federal Government is there to assist our country's servicemembers, I have introduced the bill that we are debating here today, the Military Reservist and Veteran Small Business Reauthorization and Opportunity Act. This legislation will support and expand entrepreneurial opportunities for veterans and Reservists to ensure that their livelihoods are not compromised because of their military service.    My bill increases funding for the Small Business Administration's Office of Veteran Business Development to $4.4 million and facilitates the coordination of all Federal agencies to focus attention on increasing the success rate of and opportunities for veteran-owned small businesses.    This legislation will make the Advisory Committee on Veterans Business Affairs permanent, strengthening the focus and input advisory committees can provide to the Federal Government to ensure continued commitment to our Nation's veterans. The Advisory Committee has been an important source of information for the Federal Government. By making the committee permanent, we can continue to improve the support provided to veteran and Reservist small business owners.    We will also increase the number of Veteran Business Outreach Centers across the country and identify areas that are in need of additional assistance to ensure that veterans and Reservists in every region are able to keep their businesses afloat.    Through grants of up to $300,000 per year made to Small Business Development Centers, this bill will establish the Reservist Enterprise Transition and Sustainability program to provide one-on-one counseling on management, financing, procurement and regulatory assistance to small business owners to help our returning service men and women successfully transition to civilian life.    Finally, my legislation makes much-needed improvements to the Military Reservist Economic Injury Disaster Loan program by requiring the SBA to extend the application deadline, raise the maximum loan amount and create a pre-consideration process for small businesses applying for assistance during military deployment. This is important, because currently Reservists can apply for a loan only after deployment, when their businesses are already in the red. A pre-deployment loan would be helpful to many small business owners during active duty when the funding is most critical.    Madam Speaker, there is no question that veterans have a unique ability to thrive as entrepreneurs. They have the leadership skills and work ethic necessary to run a small business and a successful business. But we must do more to help veteran entrepreneurs fully meet their needs and overcome the unique challenges that they face.    I believe that we owe no greater debt than to our brave men and women in uniform, and it is essential that they are afforded every opportunity for economic success at home, especially given their sacrifices for us abroad.    I strongly support the Military Reservist and Veteran Small Business Reauthorization and Opportunity Act, and I ask my colleagues to support this important legislation. Mr. ALTMIRE. (MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2009 -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I thank the gentleman. I could not be more proud of this bill that we are debating here today and that we are going to pass tonight.    Last year, we provided $12 billion in increased funding for the VA health care system, the largest single year increase in the 77-year history of the VA. Today, we follow up with a $4.6 billion funding increase, representing an 11 percent increase over that high bar that we set last year.    We are proving once again tonight in this Congress no group will stand ahead of our Nation's veterans when it comes time to make funding decisions.    The increased funding allows for enrollment of Priority 8 veterans. Priority 8 veterans have not been enrolled since 2003, as part of the Bush administration's cost-cutting efforts, and approximately 50 percent of all uninsured veterans today are Priority 8 veterans.    This bill will allow us to hire over 2,000 more claims processors to decrease that backlog that we have, which is now almost 400,000 cases, with 2,000 new claims processors.    In western Pennsylvania, where I'm from, there's a 6,000-case backlog. Those claims remain unanswered. So we are going to clear that up with this funding today.    In February, I testified before the House Budget Committee about the importance of increasing funding for our veterans' programs. I was pleased to vote on the floor of this House this year and last in favor of a budget resolution that met and exceeded the commitment that we have made to our Nation's veterans.    I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill. I congratulate Chairman Edwards on his work on this. It's a bipartisan bill. We are all on this together. Mr. ALTMIRE. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 4137, HIGHER EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, this bill is the next step in our efforts to make college more affordable and accessible for American families. I would like to take a moment to highlight four of the provisions I included in this bill.             This bill encourages colleges and employers to join together to form business workforce partnerships that will help graduating students find jobs and provide local businesses the skilled workers they need. It also provides grants to minority-serving institutions to help them recruit and prepare the teachers of tomorrow and improve the diversity of our Nation's workforce.    Additionally, my language added to this bill forgives the student loans of veterans who are determined to be totally and permanently disabled by the VA.    And finally, the conference report includes an amendment that I offered along with Congressman TIM RYAN to establish textbook rental programs to help students save money.    This conference report is a significant improvement to our higher education system, and I am proud to have been a part of the conference committee that reported this bill. Mr. ALTMIRE. (PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I yield myself such time as I may consume.    My amendment serves to assist small businesses in implementing the changes made by this bill. Small businesses are the backbone of our economy, and we must ensure that this legislation does not place additional undue burdens on the very entrepreneurs who continue to be the main source of job growth in our communities.        My amendment provides an additional 6 months for the implementation of this Act for those small businesses, and the Department of Labor will be responsible for educating small businesses about the law and assisting them with compliance.    The goals of this bill are laudable, and my amendment only seeks to guarantee that small businesses are not put at an unfair disadvantage when complying with this law.    Through this amendment, we will give small businesses the time and resources they need to adjust to the changes brought on by this bill.    I urge adoption of this amendment.    I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ALTMIRE. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1585, NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - December 12, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida, and I thank the chairman for his leadership, as well as Ranking Member Hunter.    I wanted to talk specifically for a couple of minutes about two provisions that this bill includes that I introduced. One of them involves a bill, H.R. 1944, dealing with traumatic brain injury, which is the signature injury of the war in Afghanistan and Iraq.    What this legislation that we are voting on today says is that the Department of Veterans Affairs will treat traumatic brain injury and do screenings and treatments in a way that is much more put together than has been done in the past. It is going to create a national registry, it is going to create a long-term system for traumatic brain injury screening and treatment, and it is going to create a coordinated network throughout the Nation that is going to help our brave men and women that are affected by TBI.    Secondly, I also introduced an amendment during consideration of this bill dealing with family and medical leave. What this legislation does is allow family members of our brave men and women serving in the Guard and Reserve to use Family and Medical Leave Act time to see off, to see the deployment, or to see the members return when they come back, and to use that, importantly, to deal with economic issues and get the household economics in order.    This bill is going to dramatically impact people's lives, and I am proud to have played a very small part in it. But I do want to thank the chairman and the ranking member for their leadership.    Madam Speaker, I also thank the gentlewoman from Florida for allowing me the time to speak today. Mr. ALTMIRE. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1585, NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - December 12, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, I want to highlight two specific provisions that are included in this landmark legislation that we are discussing today.    This bill contains legislation that I, along with Congressman Tom Udall, offered as an amendment during initial House consideration of this bill. It will allow military families to use family and medical leave time to manage issues such as child care and financial planning that arise as a result of the deployment of an immediate family member.    This bill also contains the language from my bill, H.R. 1944, that requires the VA to operate a comprehensive program of long-term care for rehabilitation of traumatic brain injury, which has become the signature injury of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. It also creates and maintains a TBI veterans health registry.    These provisions will directly impact and improve the lives of our brave men and women in uniform and their families. I am proud that they have been included in this bill. Mr. ALTMIRE. (VETERANS GUARANTEED BONUS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 17, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the bill we are debating today, H.R. 3793, the Veterans Guaranteed Bonus Act, which I introduced.    This legislation will ensure that from this point forward, every combat-wounded veteran injured in Afghanistan or Iraq receives their full enlistment or reenlistment bonus. No longer will American servicemen and women who have served our country so bravely and honorably and have been injured in service to our country, no longer will they be served with a bill to repay their enlistment bonus, and no longer will those heroic men and women suffer the indignity of having their prorated bonus payments cut off if those payments are to be made in installments.    Instead, my bill, which we are debating today, says that the full amounts due under the agreements and contracts that apply to a service combat disability be paid within 90 days of the separation of the servicemember. This legislation also applies to the family members and estates of servicemen and women who are killed in combat.    This issue first came to my attention over the summer while reviewing the Dole-Shalala Commission Report, an independent panel put into place in the spring to investigate the disgraceful situation at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. The Commission uncovered instances of our wounded warriors being denied their bonuses after being injured in combat. And after studying this issue in more detail and learning of other documented instances of this injustice, on October 10, I introduced a Veterans Guaranteed Bonus Act, which is now before us.    In the weeks after I introduced the bill, we continued to hear multiple reports of cases around the country where servicemen and women had been denied bonuses, including the high-profile case involving Private Jordan Fox from my home area of western Pennsylvania. It has become clear that these were not just isolated examples, but instead, some of the hundreds and perhaps thousands of examples of veterans being asked to return their bonuses or be denied the remaining portion of their bonuses after being injured in service to our country.    And while some have made an issue of the expense of paying back these bonuses, let me be clear: There is no group that should stand ahead of our Nation's veterans when it comes time to making Federal funding decisions. Some may argue that because these servicemen and women were injured that they were unable to fulfill their contractual obligations and therefore should be denied the remainder of their bonuses. I want to be equally clear on this point. Members of our Armed Forces have made every conceivable sacrifice for our country, and those who have been injured in service to our country have more than fulfilled the obligations of their service contract. Paying them the bonuses that they have fought for and that they have earned is the very least we can do to repay them for their bravery and their sacrifice.    Finally, I want to make clear that this is a bipartisan bill with more than 270 cosponsors. I want to thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, dozens of which have cosponsored this bill and some of whom will speak in favor of it today. I especially want to thank my colleagues, Mr. Stearns from Florida and Mr. Jones from North Carolina, the lead Republican sponsors of this bill. They joined me in support of this bill before it became a high-profile issue, and I thank them for their leadership. I also want to single out two of my Democratic colleagues, my lead Democratic cosponsor, Congressman Patrick Murphy from my home State of Pennsylvania, an Iraq war veteran himself, and Congressman Bart Stupak of Michigan who has fought as hard as any Member of this House for the right of veterans to keep their enlistment bonus.    Most importantly, I want to thank Chairman Ike Skelton for his willingness to help bring this bill to the floor. Chairman Skelton's amendment has made this a better bill, and I thank him for his support and his continued leadership as chairman of the Armed Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in voting for the Veterans Guaranteed Bonus Act before us today. I am sure that all my colleagues in the House would agree that we in Congress must support our troops with our actions and not just with our words. This bill will ensure that every military veteran gets the bonuses they deserve. During this holiday season when our thoughts and prayers are with the brave servicemen and women serving overseas and their families here at home, I can think of no greater tribute we can provide. Mr. ALTMIRE. (MIDDLE CLASS TAX CUTS -- (House of Representatives - April 15, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Madam Speaker, congressional Democrats are prioritizing tax cuts for the middle class. Our budget made clear that we intend to extend and pay for the Bush tax cuts that directly impact middle class families.    In fact, the Democratic budget identifies the specific tax cuts that we would like to see extended, such as: marriage penalty relief; the 10 percent lower income bracket; the child tax credit; small business expensing; and the R&D tax credit.    But like our fiscally irresponsible colleagues who advocate a continuation of this administration's failed economic policies, the Democratic budget achieves balance in 4 years and ensures that any increased spending or decreased revenue must be offset by comparable budget cuts.    Rather than just charging the cost to the national credit card and increasing our indebtedness to foreign nations like China and Japan, Democrats want to go in a new direction by ensuring that our budgets are balanced and our Tax Code is fair for all Americans. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - April 25, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I thank the gentleman from Connecticut. And I wanted to spend some time talking about what this bill actually does, because I heard some rhetoric during the debate from the other side that I couldn't believe I was hearing, because it had nothing to do with the facts of what's really in this bill. I heard Members stand up and say that the goal of the Democrats is to cut the funding for our troops and cut and run and do an immediate withdrawal. And none of that is in this bill. That is not what we voted on today.    And the great thing about democracy, the great thing about this House, the House of Representatives of the United States is that we have people who represent every side of the political spectrum. And there are a handful of Members who feel so strongly about this issue that they feel we need to immediately cut the funding and immediately withdraw our troops and bring them home. And they are very vocal. And what's interesting about that group is they didn't support this bill. The people who feel so strongly that we need to cut the funding and bring our troops home immediately voted against this bill, along with the Republicans.    So when I hear Members on the other side talk about what our goals are, and then I think of the fact that they are the ones that voted with the people who want to bring our troops home immediately and immediately cut the funding, that leads me to believe that perhaps they didn't read the bill closely enough, or maybe there's just some rhetoric that's being thrown around that they know is not true.    And what I would suggest to my colleagues, and certainly to the American people, is you look at what is in this bill. And we've talked about this before when we passed the first bill before it went to conference. We give the President more money than he asked for. The conference report that we voted today, 4 billion more dollars to go to Iraq and support our troops than President Bush asked us for. That's not cutting the funding. That is supporting our troops.    We increased funding for the Department of Defense health care facilities to make sure that situations like Walter Reed never happen again. We increased funding for the Veterans Affairs health care system to make sure that we have adequate coverage for our Nation's veterans, because, as we have talked about many times on this floor, there is no group that should stand ahead of our Nation's veterans when it comes time to make funding decisions.    And this bill, for now the fourth time in 4 months, we have voted to increase funding for the Veterans health care system, and not continue the past 6 years of chronic underfunding for the VA health care system.    And finally, this bill does, in fact, add some accountability to the process. The only remaining leverage that we have left in Iraq, almost 4 years to the day after we were told the mission was accomplished, that date was May 1, the only remaining leverage we have left is our presence there.    The gentleman from Connecticut talked about how he was in Iraq, and I don't want to put words in his mouth, but I am sure you spoke to some of the leadership over there and experienced the fact that the Iraqi government has not stepped up to manage their own affairs and administer their own government. In fact, they have failed miserably in that action, and they show no  sign of being willing to step up to the plate. And the only leverage we have to make that happen, and that is the only solution to this conflict, is a political solution. There's no military solution because, it has, as you said, degenerated into a civil war. The only leverage we have there is our presence there. And until we say, loud and clear to the Iraqi government, that our presence there is not open ended, that we do consider this to be a situation that they need to step up, administer their own affairs and run their own government, nothing's going to change. And we did have, 4 years ago today, an announcement that the mission was accomplished; and we'll be here next year and the year after and the year after, and we'll still be waiting for the Iraqi government to step up unless we take affirmative action to add some accountability, which is what we did in this bill today.    So I'm going to give it back to the gentleman so he can talk to Mr. Hodes momentarily, because I know he's chomping at the bit to say what he has to say. And I'm looking forward to hearing it myself.    But I just want to be crystal clear, this bill, in no way, represents a cut in funding for our brave men and women who are serving us in Iraq. It has more money in it for our troops, direct aid for our troops, than the President asked for. Make no mistake about that.    So at this point I would yield back to the gentleman from Connecticut. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - April 25, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I thank the gentleman from Connecticut for yielding.    I want to talk about what these charts mean that the gentleman from New Hampshire is holding up next to where he is speaking. These are examples of generals, people who have seen firsthand what is happening on the ground in Afghanistan, people with the utmost military experience, who have said clearly, without ambiguity, that the President's course of action is wrong. And the course of action that we took today here in this House is endorsed by these generals. And this is a further example of the President's not listening to anybody but himself and his very, very close circle of advisers, any of whom, if they differ from him, find themselves reassigned or out on the street. And for some reason, the President doesn't listen to his generals. He doesn't listen to the Iraq Study Group.    You will recall, and I would like to remind my colleagues, that he said, when the Iraq Study Group formed and was going about their business of studying this situation and coming up with their report, that he was going to pay attention to what they said and take some of their advice. Well, unfortunately, the report came out and was promptly discarded by the administration, and they did nothing about what was in the Iraq Study Group.    Now, some of the things that were talked about that we should engage in diplomacy with countries like Iran and Syria, we know where the President stands on that. He is not going to change with that. The Iraq Study Group recommended that we do set a timeline on our activities to increase our leverage with the Iraqi Government, as I talked about earlier. But the President chose to discard that. He chose to discard what his generals on the ground said. Those that disagreed were reassigned, and some of them now, as Mr. Hodes has pointed out, are saying that what we are doing is the right course of action. But what is most important and what is most relevant for what we did today in this House, the President is ignoring the American people.    We have all seen the polls about where the American public feels about this. But we shouldn't legislate by polls; we should legislate based on we are elected Representatives of the American people. There are 435 districts in this House, each of whom has a voice, and it is our responsibility as Representatives to go back into our districts, listen to what our constituents have to say on these issues of critical importance, return here on a day like today, debate the issue the entire day, come back at 11 o'clock at night and we are still debating the issue. But we took a vote and we had to put it on the line, yes or no, where do you come down on this issue? The Congress has spoken. At least the House has spoken. The Senate is going to speak in the next day or two.    And I want to make one thing clear. Let there be there be no discussion about this. If the Senate passes the conference report, which we expect, and sends this bill to the President, as Mr. Hodes said, he has a decision to make. He can either sign that bill and provide the troops the funding that they need to continue the mission, or veto the bill and deny them the support that they need. That is his choice. The Congress has spoken on that.    So when any Member of this House has one of their constituents come up to them and say, well, when are you going to give our troops the money that they need to continue this fight? Well, we did it today. The answer to that question is we did it today. The Senate is going to do it tomorrow, perhaps the following day.    Then the President has a decision to make. And if he chooses to veto that bill, the troops' funding will be delayed. But that won't be because of us. That will be because of a decision that was made down the street at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - April 25, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I wanted to change the subject here just momentarily here, if I could, here at the end and just mention something, because unfortunately, since we're not in session on Monday due to the unfortunate funeral that many of our colleagues are going to be attending for one of our colleagues, I wanted to mention the fact that Monday is going to be Paul Hayes, the House reading Clerk's last day. Paul has been here for 20 years, and to many viewers around the country of C-SPAN, he is the voice of the House of Representatives. I was going to do a 1 minute on Monday, but I will just do it today because we're not going to be in session on Monday and just say what an honor it has been for me, Paul, to be able to spend a few months as a Member with you here.    I was a staffer, as Mr. Murphy knows, on Capitol Hill for 6 years in the early 1990s, and we used to watch Paul Hayes at work. And it has just been a great experience for me to come back as a Member of Congress and briefly be able to, for about 4 months, to be able to serve and work with you, Paul. So I just wanted to say congratulations, and we wish you all the best. Mr. ALTMIRE. (DEMOCRATS EXPAND HEALTH CARE COVERAGE -- (House of Representatives - April 25, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Madam Speaker, this is Covering the Uninsured Week, so I wanted to take this opportunity to remind my colleagues about the 9 million children in America that live without health insurance. I also wanted to take the opportunity to remind the American people that just last month, the Democratic Congress passed a 2008 budget that includes a $50 billion increase in funding for the State Children's Health Insurance Program, and we did it without raising a penny of taxes. By contrast, the President submitted a budget that, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, would cut 1 million additional children out of the Children's Health Insurance Program.    Thankfully for the American people, Madam Speaker, Democrats rejected the President's budget in favor of one that expands health care for children. Mr. ALTMIRE. (PERSONAL EXPLANATION -- (House of Representatives - May 16, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Chairman, ongoing military engagements and extended deployments impact not only our troops, but also the families of our brave men and women in uniform. Military families are struggling to balance everything from their financial obligations to child care responsibilities.    I offer this amendment to address this and provide military families with some relief. This amendment allows the immediate family of military personnel to use Family Medical Leave Act time for issues directly arising from deployment and extended deployments.    The wife of a recently deployed military serv\\x1cice\\x1cmem\\x1cber could use the Family Medical Leave Act to arrange for child care. The husband of a servicemember could use the Family Medical Leave Act to attend predeployment briefings and family support sessions.    The parents of a deployed servicemember could take Family Medical Leave Act time to see their raised child off or welcome them back home.    This amendment does not expand eligibility to employees not already covered by the Family Medical Leave Act.    I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Mr. ALTMIRE. (DEMOCRATS' LONG RECORD OF ACHIEVEMENT -- (House of Representatives - May 16, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Madam Speaker, we are now 4 1/2 months into the new session of Congress, and the Democratic Congress has a long record of achievement. We have already passed 37 pieces of key legislation, many, I am proud to say, with bipartisan support.    We have passed bills to strengthen our military, increase funding for our veterans, restore accountability, promote energy independence, lower the cost of prescription drugs and student loans, balance the budget and grow our economy. But unfortunately, not everyone got the loud and clear message the American people delivered for change last November. President Bush opposes two-thirds of those bills that we passed this session. I hope that the President will join us in moving this country in a new direction. Mr. ALTMIRE. (THE STORY OF TWO TENS IN IRAQ AND HERE IN THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - October 16, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Madam Speaker, when we as a Nation talk about our priorities, it is often useful to use numbers to put things in perspective. So today let's think about the number 10. On Thursday, this House will have the opportunity to override a Presidential veto that would allow us to ensure 10 million children have access to quality health care so that they can see the doctor of their choice when they need to. We realize the importance of preventive care. Children shouldn't be forced to let a cold or earache linger until it reaches emergency proportions.    President Bush says our bipartisan compromise is too expensive. But while we are working to ensure 10 million children have access to health care, President Bush has no problem asking us to send $10 billion every month to Iraq.    Madam Speaker, this is a debate about priorities. House Republicans should join us in overriding the President's veto to send a message that children's health care is a priority of this House. Mr. ALTMIRE. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 6049, RENEWABLE ENERGY AND JOB CREATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, in a weak economy it's important for us to take steps to help small businesses create jobs and provide targeted tax relief to middle class American taxpayers.    Today's tax relief package will encourage investment in renewable energy and energy efficient technologies. We help small businesses by extending the R&D tax credit and the State and local sales tax deductions.    Also included are extensions of three tax cuts that I introduced last year, including extending the $250 tax credit to help teachers pay for out-of-pocket expenses for classroom supplies, encouraging companies to donate computers to schools, and investing in the clean-up and development of former industrial sites, commonly referred to as brownfields.    This bill cuts taxes for small businesses, promotes energy independence, and provides targeted tax relief for middle class American families.    I urge my colleagues to support this tax relief package. Mr. ALTMIRE. (DEMOCRATS CONTINUE FIGHT TO LOWER GAS PRICES -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, with gas prices reaching a new record high every day, Congress took strong action last week to bring down the price at the pump by passing legislation to suspend filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve through the end of this year.    After initially opposing the proposal, President Bush signed the bill into law yesterday. He had the power all along to stop filling the SPR, but it took an act of Congress to push him to take this commonsense step, a step that could lower gas prices by up to 24 cents a gallon.    While the Bush administration has allowed crude oil to rise from $25 a gallon when he first took office to $130 a gallon today, the Democratic Congress is fighting to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, bring down record gas prices, and launch a cleaner, smarter energy future for America.    Today this House will consider legislation that will retain and create hundreds of thousands of green energy jobs and encourage the use of production of renewable energy. While President Bush continues to call for more of the same policies that have failed for the past 7 years, this Democratic Congress is working for an energy independence plan for America. Mr. ALTMIRE. (DUNCAN HUNTER NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Chairman, I want to take this minute to highlight one particular provision of this bill that is very important to me.    Like many Americans last year, I was outraged to learn that the Pentagon was denying combat wounded veterans their enlistment bonuses, apparently in the belief that they had not fulfilled their obligations to the military because they had been wounded in service to this country. Well, like most people in this House, I think that if you have been injured in service to this country, you have done more than we ever could have asked you to do. You have borne every burden and you have fulfilled your obligation.    So I introduced the Veterans Guaranteed Bonus Act to ensure that every combat wounded veteran gets the enlistment bonus that they deserve. That legislation has been included in its entirety in this legislation that we are passing today. I thank Chairman Skelton for including it in the bill, and I encourage my colleagues to support it to remedy this grave injustice. Mr. ALTMIRE. (ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - July 14, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. So, Mr. Speaker, here for the next hour, this is where we would like to lead this: We will continue talking about the domestic production issue; then we will transition into the issue of speculation in the market.    But at this point I will yield to my friend from Connecticut for continuing this discussion, and then we are going to start the transition. So for those of you on that side of the aisle who want to wrap up that discussion, please feel free to talk as long as you want about that. But it's our intention to then move into the market speculation issue.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Connecticut. Mr. ALTMIRE. (ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - July 14, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I thank the gentleman.    With approximately 6 minutes left, to achieve balance, the Republicans can control the rest of the time. We will certainly answer any questions, but I will say to the gentleman from Georgia: Have at it. The time is yours or it is that of the gentleman from Texas. Mr. ALTMIRE. (ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - July 14, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I thank the gentleman.    I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Westmoreland). I especially thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Barton) for these 2 hours.    This, I think, was very productive, very eventful. We had a good debate. Hopefully, this is not the last time that we will do this. I thank the Speaker for the time, for both this hour and for the previous hour.    At this point, I would yield back. Mr. ALTMIRE. (ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - July 14, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I thank the gentleman from Texas.    It is my understanding that this format has not been attempted since the 1990s, under Speaker Gingrich. So this is a recent historical event that we're engaged in here, and I really to do appreciate the gentleman and the ability to work with him, and I appreciate the gentleman from Georgia and others for talking about energy prices and gas prices. That is what we're going to do over the course of the next 2 hours.    Again, just to lay the ground rules, because it is a Special Order, all time in the first hour will flow through the gentleman from Texas. All time in the second hour will flow through our side, but we want this to be an engaging discussion where we yield back and forth and ask questions and inquire of each other.    We're going to keep this above board. This is not a game of gotcha. This is to have a legitimate, honest discussion about energy prices, about the drilling issue, about the speculation issue, and about the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.    On our side, we're going to be joined by Members who have engaged on this issue, such as Chairman Rahall of the Natural Resources Committee. Chairman Rahall is going to talk about the 68 million acres of land that are available, an issue that we know about, and that will come up. BART STUPAK of Michigan, Congressman Stupak, is going to talk about the speculation issue along with Congressman Murphy from Connecticut. We're going to have Congressman Hall from New York, who is going to talk about the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Others are welcome, who may be watching this as we speak, to join us throughout the evening.    Those are generally the issues that we're going to talk about, so I really do appreciate the gentleman from Texas for yielding the time. We're going to keep this on a balanced level over the next 2 hours, generally an hour on our side and an hour on the Republican side. I look forward to the discussion.    So, at this time, I will yield back to the gentleman from Texas. Mr. ALTMIRE. (ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - July 14, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I thank the gentleman from Texas.    We're about to enter the transition, and I would just like to enter into a colloquy with the gentleman to clarify what subject matter those who are here--I see some new faces. Mr. Burton from Indiana has come. We have Mr. Murphy from Connecticut, who is going to speak next for us. Are we going to continue talking about the drilling issue and continue along this vein? Mr. ALTMIRE. (BRING DOWN PRICES AT THE PUMP TODAY -- (House of Representatives - July 15, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, Americans everywhere are fed up with paying high gas prices. For 8 days, Americans have been asking President Bush to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a move that has brought down prices at the pump in the past. But the President continues to say no.    In 1990, when the President's father withdrew oil from the reserve, the impact on prices was immediate, and they dropped 33 percent in 2 days. In 2000, President Clinton did the same, and prices fell before oil even hit the market. And in 2005, when this President Bush made the move, the price of oil dropped again.    Now the White House claims it won't lower prices but history proves that action to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve provides immediate relief to American consumers.     Mr. Speaker, when it comes to the pain our families are experiencing at the pump and in the economy today, there is simply no time to wait. Action is needed now, and we call on President Bush to stand up for consumers and utilize the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Mr. ALTMIRE. (MEDICARE IMPROVEMENTS FOR PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS ACT OF 2008--VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (H. DOC. NO. 110-131) -- (House of Representatives - July 15, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Madam Speaker, today's vote will be a significant victory for seniors, their doctors, and home medical suppliers. I am especially pleased that two important Medicare provisions that I spearheaded are included in this bill, and after this override will be enacted into law.    This bill delays for 18 months the ill-conceived Medicare durable equipment competitive bidding proposal that, if implemented, will do serious harm to small medical equipment suppliers in western Pennsylvania and around the country.    This bill also incorporates my legislation to provide prescription drug coverage to millions of low-income seniors by permanently eliminating the late enrollment penalty under Medicare part D.    Through his veto, President Bush demonstrates that he does not share our values on these important issues. But this bill is good for western Pennsylvania and good for the Nation, and I ask my colleagues to join me in overriding this veto today. Mr. ALTMIRE. (THE UNCERTAIN ECONOMY -- (House of Representatives - December 13, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Madam Speaker, a recent poll shows that the economy is now priority number one for the American people. With home prices continuing to fall and costs continuing to rise on everything from health care to college tuition, American families are becoming more and more pessimistic about our economy.    And it's not surprising that this poll showed that the American people trust Democrats more than Republicans to handle this issue by an 18-point margin. Since taking office earlier this year, the Democratic majority in this House has passed several pieces of legislation to assist working families during this uncertain economy.    We increased the minimum wage for the first time in a decade, cut loan interest rates in half, and just last week we passed an energy bill that addresses skyrocketing gas prices and will save American families up to $1,000 per year at the pump.    Madam Speaker, this Democratic Congress will continue to work on public policy measures that help American families make ends meet during this difficult economic time. Mr. ALTMIRE. (STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE FILL SUSPENSION AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 13, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I thank the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, we get criticized a lot in this Congress for not taking a proactive approach to issues that we see facing the country. And here is an example of something where we are working together in a bipartisan way. The comments from my friend from Texas notwithstanding, this is an issue that has bipartisan support. And we can argue about how much is this going to save the American people. How much is this going to take off of a  gallon of gas? And Goldman Sachs, a group that knows something about the market certainly and the impact that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve will have on the market, says it can be upwards of 25 cents a gallon that this saves.    Now that is not a long-term solution. We understand that. And we can have the argument about whether we should drill off the coast or drill in ANWR and increase supplies in other ways or build more refineries. That is a long-term argument. What we are doing today is taking a short-term approach that is going to help families today.    We cannot continue to do nothing. This Congress has to act. And we are going to act today. And we are going to save the American people a quarter on the gallon. Mr. ALTMIRE. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, she is correct. In the State of Pennsylvania, she did a fantastic job in the State legislature in crafting Pennsylvania's plan with regard to children's health insurance. And Pennsylvania, I think, has one of the best, if not the best plans, the model for the entire country on this issue.    And we're going to be joined tonight by some other people who know a lot about health care and especially know a lot about the children's health insurance programs.    We're going to be joined by Mr. Pallone, who's the chairman of the Health Subcommittee right here in the House of Representatives for the Energy and Commerce Committee which has jurisdiction over this issue, and there's no one in this Congress who has worked harder on this issue over the years and has more experience with crafting this. He was involved in putting this together 10 years ago and now, as chairman, has certainly had a lot to say about it.    And we're going to be joined by our colleague from Connecticut, Mr. Murphy, CHRIS MURPHY, who was instrumental in his State legislature on these issues. So we really do have some folks here tonight to talk about this issue who have experience, who have detailed knowledge on this issue.    And what could possibly be more important on the domestic front than health care?    And I'm sure my colleagues would agree, as I travel around my district, I'm sure they have the same experience in their district. That's the issue that comes up more often than any other issue because it affects everybody. It is an issue that, no matter whether you're rich or poor, live in an urban setting, rural setting, you have issues with your health care costs.    Small businesses can no longer afford to offer health insurance in many cases. Large employers are having the same issue.    We have 45 million uninsured in this country, people who lack any health insurance at all, tens of millions more that live in fear of losing their health coverage or are underinsured, don't have adequate coverage to cover their needs.     And 9 million of that 45, Mr. Speaker, are children. And, unfortunately, 6 million of those 9 million children are eligible to participate in the SCHIP program. And the SCHIP program has worked. We're at a 10-year point of reauthorization. And over the past 10 years the number of uninsured children in this country has decreased by 25 percent, while the number of uninsured Americans has increased. This is a program that has worked.    And we talk a lot in this House and a lot during these discussions about the differences between what the President wants to do on the budget level and what this Congress wants to do in a variety of issues. But there is no issue on which there is a starker contrast of opinion than this SCHIP program.    We, as Democrats, want to expand the program in a way that makes sense. It's fiscally responsible, but it's going to pick up many of those 6.2 million children who lack health insurance. We want to find a way to cover those kids.    What could possibly be more important in this country than finding a way to give health insurance to children who live in families that don't have health insurance? I can't think of any more important task.    The President, on the other hand, offered up a budget that actually decreased the number of children that are going to be covered under this program by 1 million. His 5-year budget would have knocked a million children who currently qualify for the program, would have knocked them off the rolls and they would no longer qualify.    And I know my colleagues are going to talk about some of the President's comments recently about what his views are on the program, and I will leave it to them to have that discussion, as I do appreciate the Speaker's indulgence as I have to take the chair following my remarks here.    But I did want to take a moment to just emphasize how important this issue is and to talk about the difference of opinion that exists, not just with Republicans and Democrats, but especially with the administration, Mr. Speaker, and this Congress. There is a stark contrast of opinion, and we're going to have that discussion tonight.    And I thank the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania for her time and all of our colleagues here for their leadership on this important issue. Mr. ALTMIRE. (THE 30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Madam Speaker, I know that the gentleman from Florida, and I appreciate his yielding, is going to spend the bulk of his time here on the 30-Something Working Group talking about gas prices and the increase that we have seen and some things that this Congress has done to address the issue.    And I wanted to talk a little bit about the energy bill that we passed last year and the debate that took place along the way, one of which was what we should do about these taxpayer subsidies, $14 billion, that we're giving to the big oil companies at a time when they're making all-time record profits, your money and mine, taxpayer subsidies.    And it's clear that with oil at $117 a barrel and rising that ExxonMobil does not need taxpayer subsidies. They're going to make their money. They're doing quite well. They just set the all-time record for profit in one quarter in the history of American business. So there is no need for them to have that subsidy, and the majority of this House overwhelmingly agreed. Last year not once but twice, we passed legislation out of this House, in 2007, sent it over to the Senate, that would say that we are going to redirect every penny of that $14 billion away from the big oil companies and into research and development on alternative sources of energy, alternative fuels. And what we sent over to the Senate was legislation that had bipartisan support in this House.    Now, we sent it over to the Senate, and, unfortunately, as the gentleman from Florida knows, the rules in the Senate are different than the rules of the House. So they have to have 60 votes to bring a bill to the floor, and they didn't have the 60 votes to bring it to the floor, but they had enough to pass the bill. But the point of this is we in this House took affirmative action, not once but twice, to find alternative sources of energy, to create a national commitment, and to provide the funding that's necessary for R and D on alternative sources of energy.    But that's not all that this House has done. Today the leadership of the House called on President Bush to stop filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Now, that's something that I sent a letter to President Bush about last month and something that would save from the price of gas between 4 and 24 cents. Now, that's not going to make the difference. When gas is at $3.55 a gallon, 24 cents may not seem like a lot. But at least it's an affirmative step in the right direction that we need to recognize, A, that we do have the responsibility in this country to do  everything that we possibly can to relieve the burden on individuals, families, and businesses in this country and that burden that has been brought upon them by the incredible increase in gas prices. And what that is going to do is, for the temporary time being, lower costs a little bit, which is going to make a difference for families in this country. It's not going to solve the problem. It's certainly not a long-term solution. But it's something that we all can agree on in this Congress is a necessary step to suspend shipments into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That's something that President Bush has not joined us in yet, but I'm hopeful that we will be able to work together and find solutions to the problem.    Now, we, last year this Congress, passed a number of other pieces of legislation dealing specifically with rising gas prices, trying to head them off. We voted to hold OPEC accountable for oil price fixing. It passed this House 345-72, overwhelming bipartisan support. It faces the threat of a veto on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. We voted to crack down on gas price gouging. That passed 284-141, overwhelmingly bipartisan; yet the President, again, has threatened to veto that legislation. As I talked about, we voted to repeal the subsidies of the big oil companies at a time when they're making all-time record profits and redirect every penny into alternative sources of energy. Unfortunately, that faced a veto threat, and we were unable to get it through the Senate.    But what did become law, and at this point I would turn it over to the gentleman from Florida, was our new energy independence law, which, for the first time in 30 years, increased the cafe standards, the miles-per-gallon average that we see in our cars that are made in this country, for the first time in 30 years, from an average of 24 miles per gallon to an average of 35 miles per gallon. That by itself, when it's fully phased in, is going to save the average individual in this country about $1,000 a year on their fuel bill. That is real reform, and that is something that this House did, working with the Senate. We sent it to the President. He signed it. And that's something that we can definitely look forward to in the future. Now, again, that is not by itself going to lower the price of gas. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve shipments that we are talking about is going to have an impact but not a long-term impact. The only thing that we can do to solve this problem in the long term is to get ourselves off of oil. That's what this should be about. And we do have a healthy debate in this House and among our colleagues on how to achieve that.    There are some folks who believe that the issue is entirely supply and that we should spend our money at the Federal level in ways that will further our dependence on foreign oil. Build more refineries, drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, drill off the coast of Mr. Meek's Florida, drill in the Outer Continental Shelf, that is one school of thought. And those are folks in this House that have the intent to bring down gas prices. They definitely have good thoughts in mind on that.        We just have a very strong disagreement. We don't question their motives. We just believe there's a better way. That is to use every penny that we spend in this country, whatever dollar amount that may be, on alternative energy. Whatever we determine to spend, spend it all in getting us off of oil. Don't spend one penny in furthering our dependence on oil because that is not going to solve the problem in the short-term and certainly not in the long-term.    So that is the difference of opinion that exists, should we invest in research and development and finding an alternative source of energy, getting us off of oil, or should we invest on the supply side for today in a way that is going to further and even deepen our dependence on oil. That is the debate that exists in this House.    So at that point I would thank the gentleman from Florida for his strong leadership on this issue, for allowing me the time to speak, and I would turn the time over to Mr. Meek from Florida. Mr. ALTMIRE. (THE 30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I thank the gentlewoman from Florida and the 30-something Working Group.    I was in my office doing some work after the district work period, and I heard the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Meek) speaking on veterans and the problems at Walter Reed. I had to come down here and join in the conversation, and I appreciate your offer to do so.    I want to tell you about a few things that happened in my district back home. I had several meetings with organizers and folks in the veterans community in my district. I toured a VA hospital that is undergoing a major expansion. As we were doing this throughout the week last week, the articles from The Washington Post about what was happening at Walter Reed appeared.    I have to tell you that the veterans community in my district, and I am sure in other districts around the country, my veterans were outraged at what was happening there because  there has been a lot of talk during the debate on Iraq and other forums that certain individuals are not supporting the troops and not displaying the right commitment to the troops, and there is a partisan affiliation with that. But I want to tell you, we have a situation taking place at Walter Reed where we have veterans returning from Iraq and from Afghanistan, as has been pointed out, with severe injuries. These are 19 and 20 year olds, with severe, long-term, lifelong injuries. These are the people that we are talking about when we are having the debate on Iraq and Afghanistan and who is supporting the troops and who is not.    I would leave it to others to determine who is at fault here. That is not what this is all about. What this is about is protecting our veterans and finding a way to improve the system.    I have to say I shared the outrage of the veterans in my communities when I heard about these articles because these are the people that are fighting for us overseas that are in harm's way, and the situation in Iraq and Afghanistan is going to be the subject of another debate coming up on funding and we are going to hear some rhetoric thrown around I am sure on this floor and other places about support of our troops and who has been supportive of our troops.    As the gentlewoman from Florida knows, during the debate on the budget, the continuation resolution, I was one who pushed very hard for increased funding for our Nation's veterans. I want to say that our leadership was able to put in $3.6 billion in funding increases for the VA health system. I have said many times, and I will say it here again tonight, Mr. Speaker, that I will never support a budget bill that does not fund the VA health system to maintain the current level of services every year that that budget funds.        They have been neglected for far too long, and we have seen what has happened at Walter Reed. We have seen the situation as outlined in great detail, and I do want to commend The Washington Post for the job that they did in putting forward these facts because these are things that needed to be known.    We have a backlog in the VA of 400,000 cases. A 400,000-case backlog in the VA health care system. Mr. Speaker, that is just unacceptable in this time.    So I will yield back, but I did want to say that I was in my office, and I just could not resist the opportunity to come down one more time and say that I share the frustration of the Members here, the 30-something Working Group, on this issue because I personally am a little bit tired of the rhetoric that certain people are not supporting the troops. I agree that there are people who are not supporting the troops, and I will leave it to others to determine who that is, but I do not think that that has a place in the debate when we have a situation at Walter Reed that has been outlined. We have a budget situation where we have not funded our veterans as we should have in past years, but we are going to make up for it with this year's budget and continuing budgets. Mr. ALTMIRE. (THE 30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I would add to that, the gentleman from Connecticut has eloquently outlined the types of people that we are talking about, that find themselves in this situation in our veterans hospitals. We are talking about people who really are American heroes. These are the best and brightest of our society. These are people who have left their families, as the gentlewoman from Florida has outlined. They have left their children. They are taking three, sometimes more, four tours, and they come back home.    They find themselves in a military hospital. They find themselves backlogged on waiting lists. It takes 6 months to 2 years to access your health benefits at the VA. This is shameful treatment for people who are our heroes in this country. We need to have a national commitment to supporting our veterans.    These are people who put their lives on the line for us. These are people who have left their family, as we have talked about, and we have had a situation in recent years where we had not given them the help that they need on the VA health side. We have made a commitment in the new Congress that we are going to make up for that as we have talked about.    But I do want to make clear that everyone in this House realizes, both Republican and Democrat, that these are the heroes of our society. Nobody is going to argue with that. These are folks that we applaud them for their efforts. We thank them and we cannot show our gratitude in any more forceful way than to give them the funding that they need when they come back home and find themselves in a VA health care facility or receiving treatment at the veterans facility, even on an outpatient basis. Mr. ALTMIRE. (THE 30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Could the gentleman yield for a moment? And then I will yield to the gentlewoman from Florida. On that point, I wanted to tell another story that happened when I was back in the district.    I was at a fire hall meeting some folks, volunteer firemen and firewomen, and we were discussing the budget and one of them talked about how there needed to be support for our first responders. And I said, well, I completely agree, and I was disappointed to see that in the budget that the President submitted he cut funding for first responders, and in fact he cut fire grants by 55 percent. And the people around just couldn't believe that. They said, well, that can't possibly be true. That is not what they had heard; that is not what they had been led to believe. So, thankfully, the miracle of modern technology, I had my BlackBerry in my pocket and I pulled up the House Budget Committee, and Chairman Spratt has put together a wonderful Web site. If you go to house.gov, any of your constituents can pull up the Budget Committee's Web site and look at the President's budget, and there is a specific page on there on what the President's cuts proposed are for first responders. And sure enough, there is a 54.7 percent reduction in grants for firefighters. He almost completely zeroes out the COPS program.    So when the gentleman from Florida talks about how important it is that we have homeland security funding back home and we fund our first responders, well, somewhere along the line there is a disconnect when it comes to what they are proposing down on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, because they don't seem to be getting that message.    So I did want to tell that anecdote, that our men and women who are courageous in the communities and serving as volunteer firefighters depend on these grants and they depend on the help that they need, and we in the Democratic majority are going to make sure that they get it. But there does seem to be a disconnect on some sides as to what has been the case.    I would yield to the gentlewoman from Florida. Mr. ALTMIRE. (GENERAL LEAVE -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Madam Speaker, we are increasingly concerned about the downturn in our economy. The declining stock market, weak dollar, high gas prices and home heating costs, and stagnant wages have caused financial insecurity for families across America. Unemployment is now at a 2-year high, and personal debts are at an all-time high.    More and more families are being squeezed financially, making it harder for them to afford basic health coverage. The SCHIP bill we are considering today affects 10 million children living in families that work hard and play by the rules but can't afford health care for their kids.    We in Congress continue to work in a bipartisan manner to stimulate the economy and help American families threatened by this recession. I can think of no better way than to vote today to override the President's SCHIP veto. Failure to do this will lead to an increase in the number of children living in America without health care. Mr. ALTMIRE. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3915, MORTGAGE REFORM AND ANTI-PREDATORY LENDING ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 15, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 825 provides for consideration of H.R. 3915, the Mortgage Reform Anti-Predatory Lending Act of 2007, under a structured rule. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate controlled by the Committee on Financial Services. The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill, except for clause 9 and clause 10 of rule XXI. The rule makes in order the Financial Services Committee-reported substitute. The rule also makes in order 18 amendments printed in the Rules Committee report.    Mr. Speaker, let me begin by thanking and congratulating Financial Services Committee Chairman Frank and Ranking Member Bachus for truly working in a bipartisan fashion to develop this legislation. I would like to point out that the legislation was approved by the Financial Services Committee last week by a vote of 45-19 with support of nine Republicans, including the ranking member. It is this type of bipartisan spirit that the American people demand from Congress, and we as the new majority will continue to provide that.    Mr. Speaker, the subprime lending crisis threatens our Nation's economic security and the dreams of homeownership for many American working families. Now more than ever, American families are at risk of losing their homes. In the second quarter of this year, more than 286,000 mortgage loans entered the foreclosure process.    With the housing market in decline, foreclosures pose a grave danger to the stability of local property values and to our national economy. This lending crisis can be traced to rapid increases in the subprime mortgage, most of which were made with no Federal supervision. This lack of supervision allowed some lenders, not all, to prey on innocent consumers' dreams of achieving homeownership and force punitive subprime mortgages upon them.    Many of these predatory loans feature low teaser introductory rates which lure borrowers who may be eligible for lower fixed rates into loans they have little chance of repaying once the rates increase.        Mr. Speaker, the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act would require lenders to prove that borrowers can in fact repay their loans and ensure that vulnerable consumers aren't pressured into refinancing their loans unless the refinanced loan will be to their benefit. And to further protect borrowers, the legislation would curb incentives to steer consumers to high-cost loans and enhance consumer protections for high-cost mortgages.    Finally, the legislation would also provide long overdue and much needed regulation of the lending industry by requiring that mortgage lenders be licensed by States.    Mr. Speaker, every American deserves the opportunity to achieve the American Dream of homeownership. I am proud to stand here today with my colleagues from both sides of the aisle as we take meaningful, commonsense steps to help more American families achieve that dream.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ALTMIRE. (RACHEL CARSON POST OFFICE BUILDING -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Illinois and the gentleman from California for their very eloquent remarks.    This is a very special day for me. I grew up in southwestern Pennsylvania, right across the river from Springdale, Pennsylvania, where Rachel Carson was born and raised and where she is truly a legendary figure. She is an icon in western Pennsylvania, and this is a very special year for Rachel Carson's memory because May 27, 2007, would have been Rachel Carson's 100th birthday.    And she has received tremendous honors throughout her life. We do have, as the gentleman said, bridges named after her and schools and other things. But I can think of no greater representation for the beginning of Rachel Carson and the beginning of the modern environmental movement than to have the post office in her hometown of Springdale named after her. And, ironically, Springdale itself last year celebrated its centennial, so she was born in the very early days of Springdale. And this bill has widespread support throughout the district that I represent, the Fourth Congressional District where Springdale is located, but also throughout all of western Pennsylvania and all of Pennsylvania. And I do thank the gentleman for his kind remarks. But I wanted to talk a little bit about Rachel Carson.    As I said, she was born in 1907 in Springdale. She graduated from the Pennsylvania College for Women, which currently is known as Chatham College. And Rachel Carson got her degree in English, which would serve her well in her writing career over the years. She earned her master's degree in zoology from Johns Hopkins University, so she has very strong ties to Maryland, and I am going to talk a little bit more about that because she taught zoology at the University of Maryland, right down the road from where we are right now. And while she continued her studies at the Marine Biological Laboratories in Woodshole, Massachusetts, she continued her teaching career. So in the very early days, she was getting to know the environment and getting a greater understanding of the world around her and what was to come in her life.    Now, according to Time Magazine, ``It was there in her early twenties that she first saw and became enchanted with the enormous mysteries of the sea.'' And as I talked about, this was a lifelong passion for Rachel Carson. Her early writings at the time focused on the waters and the seas, and I believe a lot of that has to do with her upbringing in Springdale, Pennsylvania, because the Allegheny River flows right through the town there, right along the river, and she spent a lot of time studying the river in her youth growing up. And the Rachel Carson homestead, which is her childhood home, has been restored. And there is an active and ongoing presence there in the town, and the stories are legendary about her spending hours and hours of time sitting there on the riverbank, studying the waters and thinking about it. And those who knew her at the time knew that that was her passion and that was going to be the direction of her career and her life.    In 1936 she went to work as a junior aquatic biologist at the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, again very suitable to someone with that level of interest and that educational background. She was the second woman in the history of the agency to hold a full-time professional position. So she was a trailblazer right from the start. And her early writings, as the gentleman from California mentioned, Under the Sea-Wind, The Sea Around Us, and The Edge of the Sea, celebrated the wonders of nature and continued her ongoing expertise and interest in aquatics and the sea. The Sea Around Us won the John Burroughs Medal, which was then the equivalent of what is today the National Book Award. So here we see the beginnings of a writing career. And this is where her English degree comes back, and she now has expertise in not only zoology and water and the Bureau of Fisheries as her profession, but she begins a long and fruitful career as an author, so she wins what is then the equivalent of the National Book Award. And within the first year, this was in the 1930s, that book sold over 200,000 copies.    Rachel Carson is most famous, of course, for her book, Silent Spring, which was published in 1962, and it criticizes the use of pesticides, particularly DDT, but not exclusively. It is widely created with launching the modern environmental movement, including Earth Day, which just over this past weekend we celebrated Earth Day all across the country while Rachel Carson is credited with the founding of that movement as well. So, again, this is a very timely measure today, and I do encourage my colleagues to support it.    I did want to mention that, unfortunately, it was not long after the publishing of Silent Spring that Rachel Carson took ill and breast cancer took her life at the early age of 56, in 1964. But that did not end the legacy of Rachel Carson. In 1980 she was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which all of our Members here know that is an incredible honor to be bestowed upon someone. And in 1999 Time Magazine recognized Rachel Carson as one of the 20th century's 100 most influential Americans, again a fantastic and well-deserved honor.    So, again, throughout western Pennsylvania this year, her 100th birthday we are celebrating Rachel Carson. And it is important, having just had Earth Day over the weekend and the increasing awareness of the environment around us, that we do allow Springdale Township, where this is a very popular measure and something that we have been waiting to see this day come. I would ask my colleagues to show their support and recognize the tremendous contributions that Rachel Carson has had not only for western Pennsylvania, not only for the United States of America, but around the world. She truly is an icon, and she truly did change the world.    So at this time I would like to thank the gentleman from Illinois for allowing me to bring this bill forward. I thank the committee, and I thank the gentleman from California. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - December 19, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I appreciate the gentleman from Florida taking the lead in putting this hour together tonight.    Starting tomorrow, I am going to go around my district and talk about what we have done in this Congress. For me, this is an exciting time. As a freshman Member of Congress wrapping up our first year, the gentleman is correct, we have some enormous achievements to talk about. Right from the very first day, something that we talked about last night, we did reform of the ethics process here in the House of Representatives, including PAYGO budget scoring. PAYGO is something that business owners across the country know, and every person that runs their household knows. It is what you do with your own home checkbook. You have to have money on one side of the equation to spend it on the other. If you want to decrease revenues or increase spending, you have to have an offset. That is something that we did on the very first day.    That used to be the case in the House of Representatives. It was put into place in 1990, as the gentleman certainly knows. It led to the record surpluses of the 1990s when we had four consecutive budget surpluses following the all-time record deficits of the 1980s.    Unfortunately, when this administration took office in 2001, they did away with PAYGO and the Republican Congress at that time agreed that PAYGO shouldn't be expanded and reauthorized. And as a result, we now have had seven consecutive budget deficits, deficits that are forecast as far as the eye can see.    The most troubling part of those deficits is when we are borrowing against our children and grandchildren, putting our increased spending on the credit card and letting them take care of it later, the most troubling part is who is holding this debt that we are creating. And the gentleman from Florida was very articulate when he talked about the foreign-held debt and that this administration in the first 6 years added more foreign-held debt to this country than his 42 predecessors combined in 230 years.    So we have an administration that has no standing to lecture us, this new Congress, on fiscal responsibility coming as the all-time highest spending administration and record deficits.    So what we did on the very first day was put in place PAYGO budget scoring. We took a vote today, our last day, on the alternative minimum tax. And a lot of Members on the other side of the aisle talked about the fact that this is the first bill of this new Congress that did not comply with PAYGO scoring because we had to lower taxes for 23 million Americans because those are Americans that would have seen an increase in their taxes had this Congress not taken clear and decisive action today.    And we did it. One of the things about this job which I am finding out as a new freshman, and the gentleman from Florida and the gentleman from Ohio have known for a long time, you have to make tough choices. One of the choices we had to make today was the Senate sent us a bill that I wasn't entirely happy with. I didn't like the fact that the other body made a decision not to comply with pay-as-you-go. I had a choice to make, and I chose to lower taxes for 23 million Americans, 70,000 in the district in western Pennsylvania that I represent.    Now we will have to pay for that in the future, and hopefully we will do that as one of the first orders of business when we come back after the holiday break. But I am proud of the accomplishments of this Congress. I am proud of the fact that we can go home and talk about raising the minimum wage for the first time in 10 years.     Is there any other segment of our society that can say that they haven't seen even a cost-of-living adjustment, even a minor increase in their pay in the last 10 years? I don't think there is. So, for the first, time we raised the minimum wage.    We have an energy bill to talk about. The first time in 30 years that we have increased the mileage standards, the average mile-per-gallon standards of the fleet serving this country, foreign and domestic automobiles. That is a major accomplishment. Something that hasn't been done in three decades.    We can talk about these accomplishments, and I want to yield some time to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ryan) because I know he is chomping at the bit to talk about his experiences this past year. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - December 19, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. On the subject of investments, that is something that had not been done in this Congress. We talked about the 6 years prior to the new Democratic Congress taking over, one of the things that had been unresolved was a water resources development bill, which is the critical infrastructure needs across this country, the most obvious of which is the gulf coast in Louisiana and Mississippi, what happened with Hurricane Katrina and the unmet investment since that time.    But all across this country, including in my district, we had severe flooding in western Pennsylvania in 2004 and again this summer. And we continue to have this discussion, and I am sure you have the same thing in Florida, that after the fact we come in and say, Why wasn't something done to prevent this? Why didn't we improve, in the case of western Pennsylvania, the locks and dams and the critical infrastructure that needs to be done to prevent the floods? Why didn't we bring in the Corps of Engineers and do the research and do the construction necessary to prevent the disaster from happening in the first place?    Well, that hadn't been done. The water resources development bill, WRDA, the WRDA bill hadn't been done. In 2-year increments, it is supposed to be reauthorized. They hadn't done it in 7.    So what did we do when we came into this new Congress? We made the difficult decisions and did the water resources bill. And as a result, $90 million in infrastructure investment is going to go into western Pennsylvania and fix this problem that I discussed in my district.    I know there is money going into the Florida districts that Mr. Meek and Ms. Wasserman Schultz represent, and I am sure Mr. Ryan has some need in his district.    But the critical investment in infrastructure is something that had been ignored for so long in this country. We are dealing with it. We made the difficult decisions and passed the bill, and we overrode the President's veto on it.    I do hear in my district frustration: Why aren't you taking on the President and why don't you do more to overturn his decisions? Well, we have divided government, and under the Constitution, in many cases the President, the executive, has the upper hand, especially in foreign policy.    He has vetoed a number of things. He has vetoed the children's health bill twice. Unfortunately, we lack the votes by a small margin to override those vetoes. He vetoed some of our appropriations bills. Multiple vetoes that we have come close to overriding on.    On the water resources bill, overwhelming bipartisan support to do the critical infrastructure investment that will prevent the flooding and that will prevent disasters in this country. I am proud of that accomplishment. That is something that hadn't been done. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - December 19, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. If I could tie this all together, what we're talking about with pay-as-you-go, and the gentlewoman talks about the energy bill. And the gentleman from Ohio talked about the College Cost Reduction Act dealing with student loans. Let's tie this together. What does it mean to pay as you go, to pay for what you're doing? Well, with the College Cost Reduction Act we did things that are going to substantially improve the lives of middle-class Americans all across this country. They're going to make a real difference for families in America. We cut in half the interest rates on student loans from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent, which, by itself, if we did nothing else, would save the average student on student loans in this country over $4,400 over the lifetime of their loan. But we didn't just stop there. We increased Pell Grants, the staple of student support in this country, to $5,400, the largest increase in the history of that program. And we capped at 15 percent of discretionary income the amount that the borrower, after they graduate, would be required to be burdened with debt to repay their student loan. These are things that are going to make a big difference. But they cost money. It had a $20 billion price tag, which is a substantial amount of money. And unlike previous Congresses, instead of charging it to the credit card and saying, Nicky Ryan, you're going to have to pay for this in 30 or 40 years, for the rest of your life, this is something that you, as an individual, we're going to take the initiative as a Congress and we're going to pay for this up front. And what did we do? We went to the big banks and the lenders who've turned a hefty profit on the backs of students and parents in this country for years and have done quite well with these student loan programs and we've said it's time to pay your fair share. And we took the subsidies from the big banks and the lenders and redirected every penny of them into the student loan programs to help students and parents in this country.    Similarly, with the energy bill, we had the $14 billion subsidies that were going to the big oil and gas industry at a time when they were making all-time record profits. They're doing quite well. I don't think anybody can argue that the oil and gas industry is suffering right now. They're doing very well.    So we said, we're going to take away those subsidies at this time when you're making all-time record profits. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - December 19, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Thank you. And we're going to redirect that $14 billion into research and development of alternative fuels, alternative energy, which gets us off of the foreign oil which is what the President talked about doing. It lessens our dependence on foreign oil, and it helps the environment by having clean-burning fuels and renewable energy, all of those things that everybody talks about, and we paid for it; $14 billion directly paid for by those subsidies.    Now, in the other body, unfortunately, we fell one vote short. They had 59 votes. That's much more than a majority, but the rules are a little bit different in the other body, and they need 60 votes now to move on legislation, which is a subject for another day, the fact that that rule is there.    But the point is, that's what it means to pay as you go. We're doing very good things. When they cost money, unlike previous Congresses, we're paying for it up front in a budget neutral way.    So I will yield back to the gentlewoman from Florida. And I think the gentleman from Florida, who controls the time, is looking to wrap up here shortly. Is that correct? Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - December 19, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I just want to say very quickly, Mr. Murphy's not here, our fifth partner here, but the three, the gentlewoman from Florida, the gentleman from Ohio, the other gentleman from Florida have done a magnificent job over the years of carrying the 30-Somethings and getting the message out at a time when it was very difficult to do so.    And now, luckily, times have changed, and now the Democrats are in the majority, and it's a little bit easier to control the agenda and talk about issues and move forward.    I just want to say what an honor it is for me to have been a part of the 30-Something Working Group, and I know Mr. Murphy would say the same, that we were very familiar with the group and had seen you in action for many years, but as we are now the last group to speak on the last day of the first session of the 110th Congress, I didn't want to let the moment go by and say it's great for me.    And I love especially the geographic diversity that we have where Ms. Wasserman Schultz and Mr. Meek have their districts next to each other in south Florida and Mr. Ryan and myself have our districts next to each other on the Ohio-Pennsylvania border. So we have fun with that from time to time for sports analogies and weather and so forth, but it really is an honor for me to be here, the same media market. Mr. ALTMIRE. (NATIONAL WORK AND FAMILY MONTH -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Education and Labor be discharged from further consideration of the resolution (H. Res. 1440) expressing support for designation of the month of October as ``National Work and Family Month,'' and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.    The Clerk read the title of the resolution. Mr. ALTMIRE. (HONORING THE SACRIFICES AND CONTRIBUTIONS MADE BY DISABLED AMERICAN VETERANS -- (House of Representatives - June 10, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I thank the gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this resolution establishing Disabled American Veterans Week.    I introduced this resolution to express my gratitude and to allow the entire Nation to express our gratitude to those brave men and women who have given so much in the name of freedom.    I would especially like to thank Congressmen Bilirakis, Boozman, Lynch and the over 100 other original cosponsors who joined me in support of this resolution.    Over 2.8 million men and women who fought for our country have sustained injuries that have forever changed their lives. It is my hope that by establishing Disabled American Veterans Week we will increase awareness of the struggles that America's heroes face every day and encourage more support for our brave wounded warriors.    I ask my colleagues to join me today in recognizing the great sacrifices made by disabled American veterans and their families. These heroes epitomize the meaning of service and sacrifice, and this is the very least we can do to honor our Nation's disabled veterans. Mr. ALTMIRE. (ENSURING CONTINUED ACCESS TO STUDENT LOANS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 16, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this legislation which I joined with Chairman Miller in introducing to ensure that the nationwide credit crisis does not prevent students from attending college. Recent decisions to suspend the issuing of student loans by the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency and other lenders demonstrates the need for this legislation.    This bill takes several proactive steps to make certain that students are able to access the financial aid they need to pay for college. It gives the Department of Education the temporary authority to purchase loans from lenders in the Federal Family Education Loan Program. This will provide additional liquidity to the market so that lenders can continue to make student loans. Furthermore, the bill increases Federal loan limits for students by $2,000 a year, which will reduce students' dependence on more expensive private loans.    I thank Chairman Miller for his leadership on this issue, and urge all of my colleagues to support this critical legislation. Mr. ALTMIRE. (IMPACT OF THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET ON AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - February 05, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We are going to initiate the 30-something Special Order, as we have done so many times in the past. I am filling in for our colleague Mr. Meek from Florida, who usually is in this spot leading the way. But he attended the Super Bowl, which was in his district yesterday, and made it back today and had some things to take care of. So we are going to do ably in his absence tonight. But I appreciate the Speaker's generosity to give us the hour tonight.    We are going to talk tonight about the President's budget and the impact that is going to have not only on the Nation and on the Congress and what we are going to need to do, but I am going to talk specifically about what this budget does to my home State of Pennsylvania. I have some statistics on health care and veterans and Social Security recipients, and we will go right down the line and talk about my home State, but also what this budget is going to do for the country and what we are going to have to deal with as a Congress.    I brought down a copy of the budget so the folks at home can see what was dropped in our lap today. Each office got a copy of this budget. This is what we are talking about tonight. It is the President's fiscal year 2008 budget which we are going to talk about.    Now, as he has done in the past, 6 years in a row, now seven including this budget, the President's fiscal year 2008 budget continues with more of the same, the wrong priorities from the past 6 years and the same fiscal irresponsibility and misguided priorities that have been taking our country in the wrong direction. The President's budget is fiscally reckless and adds $3.2 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years when we use honest accounting.    Despite the President's claim, his budget does not achieve balance, Mr. Speaker, in the year 2012. The President leaves out many programs and uses accounting gimmicks to reach what he claims is a balance. But an honest assessment of what this budget does shows an increase in the deficit of $3.2 trillion over the next 10 years.    Now, that is on top of what has already happened over the past 6 years, which has been to increase the Federal deficit, the Federal debt, by $3 trillion. I would remind my colleagues that when this President took office, we had just had four consecutive years of budget surpluses and those surpluses were forecast to continue as far as the eye could see. In fact, the 10 year budget projection was a surplus of over $5 trillion.    Well, now we are 7 years down the road, and let's take a look at what has happened since then. As I said, instead of having a surplus of $5 trillion, this President has added $3 trillion to the national debt, and from this point forward, using honest accounting, this budget which the President has submitted here today is going to add $3.2 trillion more to the national debt. This is fiscally irresponsible, but the cuts that the President makes in programs are morally irresponsible, and this is what I am going to focus my remarks on tonight.    He cuts health care. He cuts Social Security through his privatization scheme which he continues to try to push, even though the public clearly opposes it. He cuts $300 billion from Medicare and Medicaid programs. He cuts terrorism funding. He cuts the COPS Program.    Mr. Speaker, this is just incredible, that the President came here for the State of the Union and talked about what his budget priorities were and what his goals were, and this budget doesn't represent any of the rhetoric that we heard in the State of the Union. Unfortunately, the reality of this budget doesn't match the rhetoric that we heard.    Now, we have been joined once again by our 30-something colleague from  Connecticut, Mr. Murphy, and I would yield to him to discuss his views on this budget. Mr. ALTMIRE. (IMPACT OF THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET ON AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - February 05, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Reclaiming my time on that point, what the President has done does not coincide with what the Congressional Budget Office says the cost of these programs is. Just because in his budget he estimates costs and ignores issues like the Alternative Minimum Tax, which needs to be fixed, doesn't mean those things aren't going to happen.    He can ignore some of the costs of the Iraq war and the actions in Afghanistan and pretend like we are not going to spend as much money as it is going to take to carry on activities there. That doesn't mean those dollars don't add up. And the Congressional Budget Office and any reasonable economist who has taken a fair look at this budget shows that he is hundreds of billions of dollars below in his estimations what it is going to cost to carry out those. Mr. ALTMIRE. (IMPACT OF THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET ON AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - February 05, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I appreciate Mr. Murphy's remarks. And for the folks here listening, I just wanted to let them know how we are going to approach this tonight for the remaining time that we have. I am going to give a broad overview of the cuts that have been made in some of these programs at the national level included in this budget that we received today; then I am going to yield time to Mr. Ryan, who has joined us and can ably respond to his side of things and how he views this budget. Then, Mr. Murphy, you can go again. And then I am going to focus my remaining time on Pennsylvania specific programs and how this is going to affect my home State of Pennsylvania.    But for the national overview, I mentioned that this budget cuts Medicare. Mr. ALTMIRE. (IMPACT OF THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET ON AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - February 05, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. To complete whatever it is that you want to say.    So the Medicare and Medicaid cuts of $300 billion, that is outrageous, that at a time when the number of Medicare beneficiaries is growing every year, the baby boomers are starting to qualify for Medicare in fiscal year 2008, which is where this budget takes us, and they are going to start retiring en masse in 2011 which is during the 5-year budget, that they would reduce spending for Medicare beneficiaries at a time when the number of beneficiaries is going up exponentially.    Now, these Medicare cuts include premium increases for millions of beneficiaries totaling $10 billion over the next 10 years. Let me repeat that. Medicare beneficiaries at home, many of them, are going to see their premiums increase to the point where it is going to add up to $10 billion in premium increases over the next 10 years.  But, at the same time that this budget slashes Medicare funding, of course it protects special interests, it leaves untouched massive overpayments by Medicare to the HMOs in the Republican's Medicare Modernization Act of 2003.    Now, many of the Federal Medicaid cuts simply increase cost to the State. These aren't costs that are going away, they are just passing the buck along to the States. So instead of assisting State efforts to reduce the number of uninsured, this budget actually impedes progress on States being able to insure children and others. Mr. ALTMIRE. (IMPACT OF THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET ON AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - February 05, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I appreciate Mr. Murphy's comments. When the President gave his State of the Union Address, he talked about energy independence and he always talks about energy independence and our addiction to foreign oil, which he likes to talk about. But here again, the rhetoric did not match the reality.    President Bush promised in his State of the Union speech that he was committed to reducing our dependence on foreign oil, but this budget fails to fulfill this promise. For example, and this is just a few examples, total energy efficiency and renewable energy funding is essentially at the level from when President Bush first took office. That doesn't make any sense for someone who claims to want to reduce our dependence on foreign oil.    In addition, the President's budget severely cuts weatherization assistance and low income home energy assistance.    Now, this budget also cuts most egregiously renewable energy grants programs. How can we expect to reduce our dependence on foreign oil if we are actually cutting the amount of money that we are putting into research and development for alternative fuels? It just doesn't add up.    Most alarming, under homeland security: Now, if there is any issue where we should be able to achieve bipartisan support on funding levels, it should be homeland security and keeping us safe at home. But particularly disappointing is this President's request for programs that support first responders. Under the President's budget, State preparedness grants and training are reduced 33 percent. They are cut by a full third. Fire fighter grants amazingly are reduced by 55 percent. State and local law enforcement grants through the Department of Justice also have deep cuts, thereby depriving our communities of the critical support they need to operate in this post 9/11 world. It just doesn't make any sense.    On jobs and the economy, the folks who came before us on the other side bragged about the economy and the job situation, but 3 million manufacturing jobs have been lost over the past 6 years. Families continue to struggle to pay the bills. I know that is the case in my district in western Pennsylvania. But this budget slashes funding for the manufacturing extension partnership which helps small U.S. manufacturers, everything from plant modernization to employee training, it cuts them by 60 percent.    Funding for the advanced technology program which sponsors research to solve manufacturing programs is also slashed. Mr. ALTMIRE. (IMPACT OF THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET ON AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - February 05, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. If the gentleman would yield on that point. That is a tax on everyday Americans. When you increase the national debt to that extent, and we are talking trillions of dollars, not even billions of dollars, that adds to the cost of every American's mortgage, for example. Interest rates go up. If you have a house that is $200,000, you are going to be paying between $1,500 and $3,000 more every single year as a result of the interest rates going up because we have to pay for that debt. When we have $400 billion of this budget that is dedicated to reducing the national debt or paying the interest on the national debt, that reduces all of our ability to meet our needs at home, because that increases interest rates and we all have to pay for that. Mr. ALTMIRE. (IMPACT OF THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET ON AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - February 05, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I thank Mr. Ryan from Ohio. I did want to take a moment or two and just point out the impact specifically that these cuts are going to have on my home State of Pennsylvania because we have talked a lot about what the budget does for the Nation and the impact those cuts are going to have. I wanted to bring it closer to home for some of my constituents, and this is what they can expect out of this budget in Pennsylvania.    We talked about Social Security and the fact that the President inexplicably once again moves toward his privatization scheme. Well, in Pennsylvania we have 1.7 million Social Security beneficiaries, many of whom could see retirement savings cut if we moved in that privatization direction.    More egregiously, the Medicare program, as we have talked about sees dramatic cuts, $300 billion of cuts to Medicare and Medicaid.    In the State of Pennsylvania, I want to talk about what this does. Pennsylvania's Medicare beneficiaries would have to pay higher premiums for coverage of prescription drugs and doctors' services.    Reimbursement cuts are going to take effect to home health agencies, to hospitals and to nursing homes. That is what the President's budget does not only around the Nation but in Pennsylvania.    This administration's budget, which we talked about assumes, an eight percentage point cut in reimbursement for Medicare physicians. I do not think anybody thinks the cost of health care is going to go down over the next several years. It is certainly not going to go down 8 percent. It usually rises in double digits each year.    The number of Medicare beneficiaries, as we have talked about, is going to go up exponentially over the next several years. Yet, this budget cuts physician reimbursement for Medicare by 8 percent. There is no excuse for that.    The State Children's Health Insurance Program, which is a program that was enacted during a period of bipartisan government, one of the ways that this Congress and the White House worked together back in the 1990s when the situation was reversed, they put together the children's health insurance program. Well, this budget submitted by the President gives $10 billion less than is needed just to maintain the current level of coverage in services. Mr. ALTMIRE. (IMPACT OF THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET ON AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - February 05, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. It is covering children that are uninsured. In Pennsylvania alone, there is 281,000 uninsured children. We are talking about children in this country that lack health insurance, and this program in States all across this country has gone above and beyond and covered these children. But again, the President's budget gives $10 billion less than is needed just to maintain the current level of service, not even moving in the direction of extending the program.     Mr. ALTMIRE. (IMPACT OF THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET ON AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - February 05, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Now, I wanted to talk about education funding. The President is going to talk about how he proposes an increase in Pell Grant funding for the first time in many years. But what he doesn't tell you is in this budget, it again cuts or freezes funds for key college programs like work study programs, which many of us benefited from, and there are millions of students around the country that benefit from that today, and it zeroes out, completely eliminates, supplemental education opportunity grants.    Now, that doesn't add up. If you are going to claim you are helping education by increasing Pell Grants on one side, and you are going to cut, and in many cases, completely eliminate other programs for higher education, those two things don't balance. As tuition and fees at schools like Penn State University and my home State increase year after year, the administration's cuts in student aid will put college further out of reach for many Pennsylvania students and students all around this country.    I wanted to close my Pennsylvania portion by talking about something I mentioned earlier, which is perhaps the most egregious part of this whole budget, and that is the fact that funding for Pennsylvania's terrorism prevention and disaster response is slashed under this budget. The President's budget guts programs that help Pennsylvania's local governments, prevent and respond to acts of terrorism and other major disasters.    The State Homeland Security Grant Program is cut. The Bush administration also cuts law enforcement, terrorist prevention programs which have helped prevent terrorist attacks. They cut the intelligence gathering, and they cut interoperability. Now, if everyone remembers back to 9/11, the biggest issue that was exposed, the biggest flaw in our response, our disaster response, was interoperability.     The police and the fire units could not coordinate and communicate with each other, and that was what we wanted to fix. What we saw in 2005 with Katrina, 4 years later, the problem had not been addressed at all.    Now, a year and a half, going on 2 years later, not only has the problem not been addressed, but the President, with this budget, does not even take it seriously, because they are cutting interoperability to find solutions to those problems.    Lastly, with regard to Pennsylvania, this budget again proposes elimination for two local crime-fighting tools that are used extensively in Pennsylvania, the Community Oriented Policing Service programs, the COPS program, COPS, and the justice assistance grants. Now, the COPS program helps Pennsylvania's law enforcement agencies hire police officers, enhance crime fighting technology, and supports crime prevention initiatives, while the justice assistance grants support State and local task forces, community crime prevention, and prosecution initiatives.    What sense does it make to reduce funding for these programs, especially at a time when we are trying to remain safe in our homeland security while we have actions taking place overseas. So I just don't see the point of what the President has tried to accomplish with this budget. We will hold it up again one more time before I yield, just so everybody can take a look at what we are talking about. This is what was dropped on all of our desks today. It does not represent the values of the American people. It slashes key funding priorities.    I would yield at this point to Mr. Murphy. Mr. ALTMIRE. (CONGRESS PROACTIVE IN ADDRESSING ENERGY PROBLEM -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, as prices at the pump continue to hit record highs, the time has come to put partisanship behind us and come together to work and solve the problems to help American people who are struggling to make ends meet.    We enacted legislation to inject into the market an additional 70,000 barrels of oil per day by suspending shipments to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve beginning two weeks from today. We raised auto fuel efficiency standards for the first time in 30 years. And we are nearing completion of a bill to regulate the speculators who manipulate the price of oil in the worldwide market.    This Congress has been proactive in doing everything we can to address the problem. Rather than pointing fingers, casting blame and trying to score cheap political points, I hope the minority in this Congress will join us in our effort to take swift and decisive action to address the rising price of gas. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I appreciate it.    We are going to continue to tell the story of gas prices, what we've just heard. And to keep on the message and to pick up where it was left off with the previous speakers, we're talking about the 68 million acres, here's the key point--a couple of key points: One is, there's 4.8 million barrels of oil per day every day that would be available underneath those 68 million acres. That's the number, 4.8 million barrels per day every day. And we'll talk later about that in comparison to ANWR and other issues, but just to keep on the message. These are not 68 million acres that the Federal Government just said we're going to give you the deserts in Arizona and we're going to give you a bunch of areas that are not productive. These are 68 million acres that are currently leased to oil and gas companies.    Now, presumably the oil and gas companies would only choose to purchase a lease if there was some possibility that there was oil and gas underneath there. And as I've said, the estimated oil and gas--or oil, at least--that's under there is 4.8 million barrels per day. But that's the key point; these aren't just 68 million randomly chosen acres, these are 68 million acres that the oil and gas companies themselves chose to enter into a lease agreement so that they can drill for oil and gas. That's the key point. And they're not doing it.    As we talked about a few nights ago, there are a variety of reasons why they're not doing it. One of the reasons is that they're stockpiling these leases to put on their balance sheet, declare them as assets and raise up their profits and help their stock price. That's part of it. Part of it is that the geological work and the surveying and the construction takes a lot of time. And that's being done on some of these acres, 68 million acres. So we're going to get there, in some cases, but we're not there yet, which gets to what we're going to talk about later.    There really is a difference of opinion among the two groups that we are hearing tonight, but there is no difference of opinion that we have to do something about gas prices. Now, we're talking about long-term solutions. I would hope there's not going to be a difference of opinion on some of the short-term solutions. We're talking about the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, 70 billion barrels per day beginning 2 weeks from today. The manipulation that takes place in the market, the commodities market by these commodities traders, we're going to deal with that issue. There are short-term solutions.    But what is in this dispute tonight and what we're debating in a friendly way is the difference of opinion that we have about what we're going to be as a country 10 years from now and 20 years from now. Are we going to remain dependent on oil? And yes, we're talking in this case about domestic oil. About 65 percent of the oil we get in this country is from overseas. We import it from countries that do not have good will towards Americans in many cases.    So what happens if we drill in ANWR and the 20 percent that remains of the oil that's known in the Outer Continental Shelf where we're not allowed to drill? Eighty percent is already in areas where we are allowed to drill, so what happens if we allow and get to peak capacity 20 years from now? We might be down to 55 percent, we might be down to 52 percent. We're still going to have a majority of our oil that we import from other countries. We're going to feed the beast for the next 20 years and we're going to be in the same place then as we are now.    So is that where we want to be? We have a decision to make as a Nation on how to spend the next 10 to 20 years. How do we want to use all the resources of this Nation and all the brain power of this Nation? Do we want to focus it on continuing our dependence on oil, or do we want to focus it on alternative sources of energy? We're going to talk about that, but I know the gentleman wants to continue along this track, so I will yield back to him. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Because I don't want you to lose the train of thought on that one.    The $2 billion figure includes the surveying and the geological work to actually find the oil in the first place, which it's not just drilling, the $2 billion is from start to peak production.    The point of the 68 million acres is we already know there's oil there. We already know where it is. They purchased the lease specifically because there is oil known to be in those lands, and they're making a conscious decision not to drill there. So the $2 billion actually supports our argument. It doesn't hurt our argument, it supports it, that there is work that needs to be done in any new lands that we make available that we've already done in the current 68 million acres that are available. That's what that $2 billion does. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. It is instructive to look at the acreage of ANWR that we are talking about. We are talking about 200,000 acres of land in ANWR that they want to make available for drilling. So we would go from 68 million acres that are currently available for drilling to 68.2 acres. That is the significance of ANWR--68 million to 68.2 acres.    And the gentleman makes a good point about the political argument. Many Members of Congress are not like this, but I think it is fair to say there are a number of people that would draw the conclusion that they want to return home, and they want to give good news to their constituents about what they are doing on gas prices, and if there were a quick fix, if there were a way that we could return home to our constituents and say, we found the magic bullet, we are going to lower gas prices by 40 percent or 50 percent. I think it is pretty safe to say we could round up a majority in Congress if there were an immediate fix to this problem that we would do it. There is not an immediate fix. So what we have here is a discussion, a friendly debate, on what the future is, and again whether to stick with oil, or whether to go to alternative energy. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. In speaking about the leadership that has been taking place over the last 8 years, we can talk about the impact that the low U.S. dollar has had on the price of oil per barrel which is a direct result of the economic policies of this administration and the three previous Congresses. Perhaps we will get to that later in the evening.    But as we talk about what the President said today, I think it is a little disingenuous, to be honest, to say that it is Congress' responsibility to open up, after 28 years of the moratorium, to open up the Outer Continental Shelf when there are two things at work here. There is the moratorium, and there is the executive order that was put in place by President Bush's father, the first President Bush. Now that moratorium has been in place since 1990. And President Bush came before the Nation today and said, ``Well, I want Congress to take away the moratorium, do away with the moratorium.'' He could right now say, By executive order, I am going to allow the leases to be purchased, the Department of the Interior to start making available these leases in the remaining portions of the Outer Continental Shelf where there is no leasing available and has not been.    Now in the past 28 years since the congressional moratorium has been in effect, we have had three Republican Presidents, one Democratic President, and we have had long terms of Democratic Congresses and long terms of Republican Congresses. And we have had times when both the legislative and the executive branch were the same parties on both sides and times where it was mixed as it is now. There have been opportunities in the past 28 years, no shortage of which for any combination of those Congresses and administrations to say, ``Let's do away with the moratorium.'' It has not happened.    The Republicans seem to be the ones who now are pushing this. They had 6 years where they controlled the House and the White House uninterrupted. They did nothing, as the gentleman said, to do away with that moratorium. And if the President is so unhappy with the inability of oil and gas companies to purchase leases to begin the process of surveying and then eventually drilling in the remaining portions of the Outer Continental Shelf, this is a key point, he could, today, as we speak, do away with the executive order that his father put into place by his own executive order and begin that process. Because that is the first step in the process, no matter what Congress does. We can't start drilling until all the initial leasing has been done. And that is what the executive order pertains to. So I think it is disingenuous for someone to criticize Congress for not taking action when they themselves have not. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. And the two areas that we are talking about, the two areas that are in dispute where drilling is not allowed today are the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, those 200,000 acres that we are talking about, and the 85 percent of the geographical reach of the Outer Continental Shelf on which drilling is not allowed. So we will hear people on the other side say, ``Well, there's 85 percent that we are not drilling in that the moratorium exists and we are not allowed to survey and do the drilling.''    Again, 80 percent of the known oil in the Outer Continental Shelf is already in areas where we are allowed to drill. So don't be swayed by the fact that people will throw out the geographical reach. It would be as if we were to say ``the entire geographical reach of the United States'' when we know that there are only certain areas where there is oil. And to that point, we talked about the 200,000 acres in ANWR.    Now, as we move forward on drilling on those 68 million acres, if we get to the point where the oil and gas companies have drilled on them all, which is going to be a long time, and if they do the surveying work and they come to the conclusion that there is not going to be any oil or any gas there for them to take up from the ground, then that is fine. Then we will say, ``You've done your part.''    But we are certainly not excited about giving them 200,000 more acres in Alaska and further development opportunities in the Outer Continental Shelf when they have those 68 million acres still available, there is oil underneath them, and we know that they are consciously making a decision not to pursue that oil. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. If I can clarify what this chart is, it's not quite accurate. It's even a more telling story. This chart shows where the known oil is in those 68 million acres that we are talking about. So that specific that they own the leases, they are able to drill there, and they are making a conscious decision not to do it. That is what that chart shows. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I had not seen that chart before, Mr. Ryan. I knew the numbers, but then you see the chart graphically where it shows a very clear trend.    What is amazing about this is that's the whole thing, and I'm going to recommend that others take a look at this chart. If there is one thing people who are viewing this tonight could look at it is the argument that we hear most often, which is simple economics: The more you drill, the more the supply, and the less it's going to cost; the numbers are going to come down.    This chart, which is using numbers from this administration, does not lie. It's exactly the opposite. Gas prices continue to skyrocket despite the fact there has been an exponential increase in the number of wells that have been drilled and in the number of permits that have been issued. This is really an amazing chart, and I hope that the gentleman will leave it up there so folks can look at it while he talks, but it completely dispels the argument on the other side that this is totally about drilling for more oil and that that's  going to guarantee that prices will come down. We are drilling for more oil. We are issuing more permits by the thousands. Gas prices continue to skyrocket and to be at an all-time high. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Because that was one of the prongs of the President's plan that he put forward today, to continue on refineries, the gentleman mentioned that the CEOs of the oil companies, who annually come before Congress and tell their stories and justify their exorbitant profits--and this is not a slight on them. This is just what they say--say they are not interested in building more refineries.    The President and Members on the other side will say, well, we haven't built a new refinery in 30 years.    That's absolutely true, but what we have done a lot is expand the existing capacity of current refineries because that's what these oil executives have said in their testimony that they're a lot more interested in doing. It's a lot more cost effective for them to expand the capacity of already existing refineries than to build new ones and to go through all that's necessary to do that. So we have increased refinery capacity in this country over the last 30 years. That has gone up--that has not decreased--while the number of refineries has gone down.    So, for the President to say, well, we've not built a new refinery in 30 years, there are a couple of things. One is we've increased capacity, but more importantly, as the gentleman has said, 88 percent of the current capacity of the refineries is being used. Why would we look at building more refineries? Why would that be such an important part of the plan if we're only using 88 percent of the current refineries' capacity? So it makes no sense for that to be the major part of your plan that you put forward.    I would suggest to anyone who is listening that, if you are expanding the capacity of refineries and you're still not operating at full capacity--you're only at 88 percent--it's probably not the best time to talk about building more refineries. It's probably not where you want to go.    So, as we continue to talk about this issue moving forward, I would suggest to the gentleman from Ohio that we talk about facts, because you hear the slogan many times: You're entitled to your own opinion. You're not entitled to your own facts.    Remember the facts: There are 68 million acres where we're currently allowed to drill where we know there's oil. The price of gas has skyrocketed despite the fact that we have exponentially increased in the last several years both the number of drilling permits that have been issued and the number of wells that have been drilled. We have greatly expanded our drilling in this country, and gas prices continue to skyrocket.    There are 200,000 acres in ANWR that we're talking about that are in dispute. If we made that available to come on line in order to drill for more oil, that would bring up the total number of acres in this country that are available for oil drilling from 68 million to 68.2 million. In 10 years, we would get approximately 40,000 barrels. In 20 years, it would be 800,000 barrels, which, according to President Bush's own Department of Energy, would reduce the price of gas by less than 2 cents. So, when you add all of these factors up, I would suggest that we can't drill our way out of this problem.    I know the gentleman is going to move on to talk about the Outer Continental Shelf, and at this point, I would yield back to him. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Before the gentleman moves on and if he could keep the acres chart up, if the other side were here, they would certainly say, well, we're talking about 44 million acres, but if you're drilling dry holes, you're not going to continue to do that; you're only going to drill where there's oil.    These are acres the oil companies and gas companies, themselves, purchased. Nobody forced them into it. Nobody twisted their arms. They sought these acres because they knew there was oil and gas underneath them. They're not randomly chosen. There are 44 million acres where we know there's oil and gas. That's why the oil and gas companies made a conscious decision to purchase the leases, so that they could have them because they know there's oil and gas underneath. These are not lands and parts of the Outer Continental Shelf where there is no oil or gas. That is simply incorrect. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Because these are 10-year solutions that we're talking about when we're talking about creating new areas where we can drill.    I think we've exhausted the topic about the number of acres that are available for current drilling. They want to increase the amount of acres.    So what, I think, is instructive to look at and what we should discuss is how we got where we are today. Some would say, well, there's no point in looking back. We have to move forward and start the process from where we are right now because we can't do anything about the decisions that were made in the past. Certainly, that is true. There are a number of factors that affect the price of gas that have led to the skyrocketing prices that families all across this country are forced to pay. We can do nothing about the increased demand in growing nations like China and India. It's a huge problem. It's going to continue, and it's going to greatly impact the price of gas moving forward. There's not much we can do about that.    The speculation in the market is something we can do something about, the manipulation that takes place in the commodities market, and this Congress is going to be bringing forth legislation to deal with that very complicated issue about how the oil commodities are traded and what the sources are of that manipulation. Congress is going to try and figure out a way that we can regulate that in an effective way.    The estimation is that that will lead to a decrease in the price per barrel of oil of up to $30 per barrel. That's a significant chunk. It's not everything. It's going to have a real impact, though, for families all across this country.    When you hear people discuss what the options are moving forward, I think it's instructive to look at the judgment of the people who are making those arguments and what the decisions they've made in the past have led to. One of the issues that has led to the increased price of oil and price per barrel on the worldwide market is the decrease in the U.S. dollar. So what is the cause for the decrease in the U.S. dollar?    Well, two of the largest reasons are the trade deficit, that the gentleman talks about, where we've added $1.5 trillion in foreign-held debt. This is only debt held by foreign nations. $1.5 trillion. That's over the past 7 years. To put that in perspective, when President Bush took office in 2001, his 42 predecessors in the 220 years up to that point had accumulated a foreign-held debt in that entire time of $1 trillion.        So the President has gone $1.5 trillion in 7 years, equaled, and then by half again what his 42 predecessors did.    The $3.5 trillion in debt that has been rolled up over the past 7 1/2 years, $3.5 trillion debt that this country simply cannot afford, so I think it's instructive to take a walk down memory lane for what the economy looked like, what the debt looked like when President Bush took office. The 10-year projection was for a $5.5 trillion surplus over 10 years, $5.5 trillion surplus. That's what we were supposed to see.    Well, it's not what we saw. We saw a $3.5 trillion deficit over only 7 1/2 years with more to come, unfortunately, because we can't dig ourselves out overnight from the huge hole that we've been given.    Now, what does that do to the price of the dollar? Well, we have seen what that does to the price of the dollar. It's almost at historic lows and oil is traded by the dollar in the worldwide market. That has had an enormous impact on the price of oil, and that has had an enormous impact on the price of gas at the pump.    So when you hear people give their opinion of where to go from here, what are the strategies we can use in both the short-term and the long term, I do think it's instructive to look at some of the ideas that those individuals had and those groups had in years leading up to the crisis that we now face.    The gentleman from Ohio may want to continue along these lines. I would yield back to him. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. The gentleman is correct. For those who may be entering the chamber at this point or joining the debate, it may seem like this is a partisan argument. It's not. What we are discussing here are simply the facts of how we got to where we are today.    I won't dwell on that argument. I think we have talked about it, but it is definitely something to consider, as we move forward, that the reason we are where we are today is the direct result of the decisions that were made in public policy over the last several years.     When you hear people advocating ways to dig us out of the enormous hole that we are in, I would suggest it is worthwhile to look at what the outcomes have been of the policies that they have put forward over the years.    Lastly, and then we can move on to the GI Bill, because I think that's a very important discussion as    well, we talk about the facts of the gas price issue. I would hope, maybe it would be helpful for us to get together with our friends on the other side and do one of these Special Orders one night.    I am sure Mr. Peterson from Pennsylvania would love to join us that night. I have a world of respect for him and his knowledge on this issue, and he certainly knows it as well as anybody. Maybe we could get together one day with a group and have a debate, not a debate, a discussion on the issue and let the American people hear the arguments on both sides.    I think we certainly would be willing to do that on our side.    But when you hear the discussion, I think we need to look at the facts. You can have your own opinion. You can't have your own facts. We talked about the fact, the chart that is next to the gentleman.    As the number of wells and the number of drilling permits have gone up, gas prices have gone up right up along with it. It is incorrect, it is false, and don't let anybody get away with saying that as you increase the amount of oil that we are drilling for in this country, the price of oil is going to go down. That simply has not happened. We have experience over the past 4 and 5 years, as you can see on that chart.    But another fact that came up time and again, over the last couple of years, I heard it in the 2006 election from people in the State of Pennsylvania where I am from, I continued to hear it over the past couple of years, that China was drilling off the coast of Cuba in waters that were 60 miles from the shores of this country in Florida. I heard it time and again. China is drilling 60 miles from our shores, and that is alarming. That's an alarming fact. Or is it a fact?    What we found out is that China is not drilling off the coast of Cuba, and those on the other side who had been making that claim, some who hold extremely high office in this country, had to retract what they said and acknowledge that, in fact, they were mistaken on that. It may be an honest mistake in some cases. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. That's the point that we are talking about. We are talking about facts. We can have a debate. We can have a discussion. There are clear differences of opinion. We are all on the same side. We all want to see gas prices lowered both in the short term and the long term. There is no animosity. This is not a game of gotcha.    It's unfortunate what happened to some of the individuals that you mentioned who put forward with great confidence a fact that turned out not to be true. But the point we are making is not gotcha. The point we are making is consider the history of the commentary that you hear from people, consider the factual basis which does not support their argument and consider the outcomes of the policies that they have put forward over the past 7 and 8 years, and that's leading us to where we are today. That's what we are talking about. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Well, if we could talk for a minute about the GI Bill, as the gentleman mentioned, there is no group that should stand ahead of our Nation's veterans when it comes time to making policy decisions, plain and simple. I think most people in this Chamber would agree with that.    So what has this Congress done recently to help our Nation's veterans? Well, last year we had the largest increase in the 77-year history of the VA, health system funding increase. We have increased screening and treatment of traumatic brain injuries at every VA health care facility.    We have extended family and medical leave to cover our military Guard and Reserve. We have covered small business entrepreneurship opportunities for returning veterans. We have increased the capital and the grants and loans that are available to small business owners who served, themselves, in the Guard and Reserve. We have a tremendous record of achievement on veterans in this Congress.    What we are taking up this week, probably, is the GI Bill. As the gentleman said, the GI Bill has not been updated since 1944 and not modernized.        So we are talking about more than 60 years since the GI bill has been modernized. This Congress took a step to say if you serve in the military for 3 or more years since September 11, you will qualify for the new GI bill which says you will be allowed to attend a State institution, State university in your State and we will pay for it because we want to thank you for what you have done for this country. You have earned that benefit. We can never thank you enough for putting your life on the line and the sacrifice that you have made and that your family made. So we are going to offer you something in the long run that will benefit all of us, educating people.    There is a continuing benefit to society of educating our veterans and giving them a step up so they can get out into society and continue their own careers, which helps everybody. And so we took that step in this Congress of modernizing the GI bill because it had been less than $10,000 that were available under the current GI bill.    I think anyone who has kids who are going to college or had to pay for their college themselves realizes $10,000 in today's world doesn't get you very far with regard to higher education.    We not only pay for the tuition at the State university rate in the State where the veteran lives, we also have a stipend for housing costs and ancillary things like books. We will not pay for everything, but we will help. And certainly the veterans who have earned that benefit deserve every penny of that, and I am sure the gentleman agrees. Mr. ALTMIRE. (CREDIT UNION, BANK, AND THRIFT REGULATORY RELIEF ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I thank the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, there are over 90 million members of America's credit unions, including more than 168,000 in the district I represent. Each of them will benefit from passage of this bill, which I strongly support. It is a bipartisan piece of legislation that is an excellent first step towards improving the regulatory framework for our Nation's credit unions and banks.    Credit unions serve a broad and diverse membership, including many low and moderate-income individuals who would otherwise be unable to access the services provided by financial institutions. This bill will allow Federal credit unions to better serve consumers and provide them with greater access to financial products and services.    I ask my colleagues to support this commonsense and long-overdue legislation. Mr. ALTMIRE. (TROOPS AND VETERANS FIRST IN GI BILL -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, last weekend marked the 64th anniversary of the signing of the original GI bill by President Franklin Roosevelt, which  honored the service and sacrifice of our World War II veterans and launched millions of families on a course to prosperity.    Last week, this House supported a new GI bill for the 21st century that will provide the same hopes and dreams to our troops fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan.    This bill is long overdue because the current GI bill fails to cover the full cost of a public education. The new GI bill restores the promise of a full 4-year college scholarship for veterans, and at a time when many of our troops are in the midst of multiple redeployments, we must keep our commitment to provide them the very best educational opportunities when their service is completed.    This bill is a promise to our veterans today and tomorrow that their service to this country will continue to be honored. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - October 17, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I wanted to talk a little bit about what the President said today as well, and he focused his remarks in large part on the SCHIP vote that we're going to take tomorrow in this House. This, as we speak, is the day before we're going to take a vote on whether or not to override the veto that the President put forward on a plan that passed with overwhelming bipartisan support from both Houses. Sixty-seven Members of the United States Senate and 265 Members of the House voted for the SCHIP bill, bipartisan.    And one of the things the President put forward today and has said in the past as well, we need to compromise; we need to come together. Well, I would say to the President, Mr. Speaker, that we have, in fact, made substantial compromise. We have come together as Republicans and Democrats. We put forward a bill in the House. The Senate put forward a bill. We conferenced a bill. We came to an agreement that passed with overwhelming support among both parties. We sent it to the White House, and the President, as he certainly is able to do under the Constitution and is his right to do so, he vetoed the bill, and we're going to have a vote tomorrow on whether or not to override the veto.    But don't pretend that this was not a compromise piece of legislation that took weeks and months to hammer out the details and to work together with Republicans and Democrats alike, voting to support this piece of legislation that enjoys 70 to 80 percent approval in the country according to recent polls.    I wanted to talk a little bit about what the President said were his problems with the SCHIP bill, and one of the things that he continues to throw out there as well: this is socialized medicine; this is a big Federal Government program that's a movement towards Big Government health care. And that just could not be further from the truth.    Let's take a look at what the SCHIP program is. This is a capped block grant. The money is capped from the Federal level. It's sent to the States and the States carry out the program. It's a State-administered program, and almost every State in the country contracts out their SCHIP program in the private health insurance market, in the private market. So this could not be further from the big Federal Government takeover of socialized medicine scheme. It's administered in the private market.    We could spend our entire hour here tonight listening to groups that have endorsed this bill, but for the purposes of refuting what the President says, I would point to the health insurance industry in this country, which is certainly never going to support anything that's remotely close or a movement towards federalized health care, socialized medicine. They support this legislation, as does, as Speaker Pelosi often says, everyone alphabetically from the AARP to the YWCA. This has overwhelming support around the country, overwhelming support among Republicans and overwhelming support among Democrats.    So, again, the President's welcome to veto this bill. He's able to do so, and he exercised that right, but let's be truthful about what's really in this piece of legislation.    He talks about how it affects families making up to $83,000. Well, what are  the facts behind that claim? Where did that number come from? That comes from the fact, as I said, this is administered by the States, and I would welcome my friend from Ohio, Mr. Ryan, as well, who has taken a break from watching the Cleveland Indians tonight.    We have $83,000 as 400 percent of poverty. There was one State in the country, New York State, applied for a waiver. Four hundred percent of poverty they wanted to cover. That waiver was denied. It did not take effect. No other State in the country does it. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - October 17, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. It was great to hear from one of the true giants of this House, the distinguished whip from South Carolina, Mr. Clyburn. Thank you for joining us tonight.    I was talking about this $83,000 income level that the President continues to throw out there, and it's factually inaccurate. It's just completely false.    As I was saying, the history of it is New York State, one State in this country, applied for a waiver, attempting to reach the 400 percent of poverty level. That waiver was denied, never took effect. Those families were not covered, but the President uses that as his example of what could happen if we put this legislation forward.    Well, the reality is, as under current law, it doesn't change in our bill; it would have to be approved. Any change in income up to that level would have to be approved by the administration. So if the President did not want to see any State move forward, he would say that that is denied, as it was denied when New York State tried to put that forward.    So to say that the $83,000 figure is the reason for his veto is just factually inaccurate, at least using it as an example.    Importantly, the bill that we passed limits the Federal matching percentage and gives States a strong disincentive for going above 300 percent of poverty which would be about $62,000. So the States have a strong incentive to not even attempt to go above 300 percent of poverty; and as I said, it's inaccurate for the President to say that that's the reason for his veto.    So I'll continue a little bit later on that, but we're joined by Mr. Murphy from Connecticut, and I mentioned earlier that Mr. Ryan from Ohio has been watching the baseball playoffs. Well, unfortunately, Mr. Murphy from Connecticut is on the other end of that. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - October 17, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Talking about the President, he said, ``I don't know who is advising him up there, but the President is really out of touch. It is too little, too late for him to be a fiscal conservative. He should have vetoed the farm bill. Now, he is against the SCHIP bill, and he wants $190 billion more for the war.''    So there are Republicans who get this. The President and a lot of these so-called fiscally conservative Republicans are Johnny-come-latelies on this issue. All of a sudden, after ballooning deficits and skyrocketing spending, now, when it comes to kids' health they are going to all of a sudden be fiscal conservatives. So it is nice; we are talking about this year's Democrats, but there are some Republicans who get that as well. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - October 17, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I want to talk about that very point. The editorial that you held up hits the nail precisely on the head. If you are the President of the United States and you want to veto this bill, at least be factually accurate and honest about why you are vetoing the bill. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - October 17, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. We have had many 30-Something sessions on that very topic and a variety of issues. My point on the SCHIP bill and the veto override vote we are taking tomorrow is, if you are going to threaten to veto or you are going to veto the bill and justify the veto, be honest about why you are doing it. Just say, ``Look, I don't agree with expanding the program. I don't think this is a good program. I don't want to do it.'' That is his prerogative  to make that case. Don't say it is too expensive when it doesn't cost one additional penny, it doesn't add one additional penny to the Federal deficit. This bill is paid for. It doesn't add one penny. Don't say it is too expensive.    We talked about the $83,000 in your chart and the USA Today, and everybody who has looked at this knows that is a false statement, to say that this allows you to go up to $83,000 unchecked, and the socialized medicine that we talked about. Don't throw those out there, because they are not only not true, they are blatantly false. So don't say that is why you are vetoing the bill. Just say, ``I don't like this program. I don't want to expand it. I don't want to give health care to 10 million children.'' That is his prerogative to say that. That would be a more accurate statement than the reasons he is giving us to veto this bill.    We have four people who want to speak. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - October 17, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I just have one more myth that I wanted to throw out there that none of us touched on, before our time runs out, and that's this idea of this bill promoting adults being in the SCHIP program. And the President used that as one of his examples. He talked about it today and has talked about it in the past.    Well, what are the facts of adults being in the SCHIP program? It is true that under the current SCHIP program, the plan that is current law and has been for the past 10 years, some States have made the determination to cover the parents of children, thinking that that will entice them to take their entire family to the doctor. And that's debatable. It's something that's certainly under a policy discussion we could have that debate.    But what does our bill do about that? Our bill's a reauthorization of the program. And the President says we're going to encourage adults to get into the program. Well, you know what our bill does? Our bill phases out adults being eligible for the program over a 2-year period. And after that 2-year period, the only adults that would be allowed into the SCHIP program are pregnant women, if it's determined by the State, again, it's a State option that they should be covered, and there's no guarantee that any State in the country would do that. But we phase out the current part of the SCHIP bill that allows adults into the program.    So for the President of the United States to stand up before a camera and say, I'm going to veto this bill    because it allows adults to get coverage under SCHIP, is again just factually inaccurate.    So with that, if Mr. Murphy is ready. I will yield some time to him. Mr. ALTMIRE. (PRESIDENT'S BUDGET IS FISCALLY IRRESPONSIBLE -- (House of Representatives - February 08, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, the 2002 budget the President submitted this week is more of the same, the same fiscal irresponsibility and misplaced priorities that we have come to expect from this administration's budgets over the past 6 years. This budget fails to put our fiscal house in order and instead adds $3 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years.    And while the President claims his budget achieves balance, he simply leaves out significant long-term costs. Well, American families can't leave out simple bills within their household budgets, and neither should the President be able to do so within his budget.    Mr. Speaker, Democrats will move us towards a balanced budget through fiscal responsibility and accountability, not accounting gimmicks. Mr. ALTMIRE. (COMMENDING THE MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY SPARTANS FOR THEIR VICTORY IN THE 2007 NCAA HOCKEY CHAMPIONSHIP -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, on April 7 in St. Louis, Missouri, the Michigan State Spartans beat the Boston College Eagles 3-1 to win the 2007 NCAA Hockey Championship, affectionately known annually as the Frozen Four.    The win gave the Michigan State hockey team their first championship in 21 years, and Spartan forward Justin Abdelkader rang it off the post and scored with 18.9 seconds to snap a 1-1 tie and bring home the championship for Michigan State.    They scored three goals in the final 10 minutes of the game, and Spartan goalie Jeff Lerg was spectacular, making 29 saves and allowing only one goal.    The Spartans won the hearts of underdogs everywhere. Their win capped an improbable four-game run by the third-seeded Michigan State team, who few considered to be championship contenders. In fact, the Spartans are only the second number three seed to make it to the championship game and the first in history to win it.    Justin Abdelkader was the 2007 Men's Frozen Four MVP, and the championship is Head Coach Rich Comley's second. He also won as head coach of Northern Michigan in 1991. He is one of only three coaches to have won titles with two different teams.    This is the second straight year that Boston College has lost in the championship game, and I did want to take a moment to highlight their achievements.    Last year, they lost in the finals to the Wisconsin Badgers, but prior to this year's championship, they had won 13 consecutive games, piling up a 29-11-2 record. They had multiple All-American candidates and two players who received All New England honors.    I want to extend my congratulations to the Spartan's head coach Rick Comley, Assistant Coaches Tom Newton, Brian Renfrew and Rob Woodward. I also want to recognize Michigan State University Athletic Director Ron Mason, President Lou Anna Simon and, most importantly, the Spartan players for their amazing season.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ALTMIRE. (COMMENDING THE MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY SPARTANS FOR THEIR VICTORY IN THE 2007 NCAA HOCKEY CHAMPIONSHIP -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I thank the gentleman from Michigan. I know there is no greater Michigan State fan in this body than him and how thrilled he was when they brought home that title. So congratulations to him.    This bill was sponsored by Congressman Stupak from Michigan, and he apologizes for not being able to be here. We had a change in the schedule due to the budget discussion that we had that went on for an hour or so. He wanted me to point out specifically how happy he was for Head Coach Comley, whom he has known for his years at Northern Michigan where he won his first championship.    Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers, and I yield back my time. Mr. ALTMIRE. (HONORING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN SENIOR GAMES ON ITS 30TH ANNIVERSARY -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.    Mr. Speaker, for 30 years the Rocky Mountain Senior Games has offered athletic competition and social opportunities to men and women, age 50 and older. Athletes of all abilities are encouraged to participate in over 30 athletic and social events. Competition is divided into male and female divisions, as well as mixed competition and by age groups. The purpose of the Rocky Mountain Senior Games is to motivate women and men over the age of 50 to pursue and maintain a healthy lifestyle.    In 2006, the Rocky Mountain Senior Games hosted 1,035 participants from 17 States across the country. The Rocky Mountain Senior Games offers our Nation's seniors the opportunity to experience the thrill of competition and the joy of camaraderie, while improving their physical fitness.    It is of vital importance that we encourage all adults to establish and maintain healthy lifestyles so that they can maintain a high quality of life as they grow older.     For 30 years, the Rocky Mountain Senior Games have helped improve the health and well-being of older Americans in our Nation. Every year, more and more seniors travel to Greeley, Colorado, to participate.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring the Rocky Mountain Senior Games.        Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ALTMIRE. (NATIONAL PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND SPORTS WEEK -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, this resolution designates May 1-7 as National Physical Education and Sports Week. This is the second year in which Congress has officially observed the first week of May for this purpose.    The benefits of physical activity are well documented. It reduces the risk of obesity, heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, back pain, and even certain types of cancer. It can increase one's self-esteem and body image and reduce anxiety. In youth, it develops motor skills, leads to healthier lifestyles, improves social awareness, and averts risky behaviors.    The Centers for Disease Control recommends 60 minutes of daily physical activity for children and teenagers, and 30 minutes of daily physical activity for adults. Moderate exercise, such as a brisk walk, when done regularly, has a significant health benefit.    As a Nation, we should be more active. One out of four children do not attend any physical education classes in school; 61 percent of children, ages 9 through 13, do not participate in any physical activity outside of school. Only 25 percent of children get a minimum of 20 minutes of vigorous physical activity per day.    Mr. Speaker, in comparison, 60 percent of adults are not regularly active, and 25 percent are not physically active at all. The lack of physical activity has many negative results. The percentage of overweight young people has more than tripled since 1980. It is 18 percent of that population today.    Children are now being diagnosed with high blood pressure, high cholesterol and type 2 diabetes, all once thought to be age related. Two-thirds of adults are overweight or obese. Obesity-related diseases cost the economy more than $100 billion annually.    I want to recognize some exemplary programs that are currently promoting and encouraging physical activity. Four thousand Boys and Girls Clubs across this country provide more than 4.6 million kids with the opportunity to be physically active. YMCA provides services to over 20 million people, including the Silver Sneakers programs for seniors.    This resolution acknowledges that physical activity and sports play a central role in creating a healthy lifestyle for children and adults. Schools should include physical education classes and other opportunities for physical opportunities as part of the school day, and this resolution says communities should be involved and support schools in the promotion of physical activities, nutrition education and healthy lifestyles.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - April 02, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I thank the gentleman from Florida, and I look forward to continuing the discussion tonight on all these issues the gentleman has brought up.    The gentleman closed with Iraq. We are going to have General Petraeus and we are going to have Ambassador Crocker come before Congress again next week and give their status report on what they see on the ground in Iraq. As the gentleman from Florida knows, he and I traveled to Iraq together last year. One of the things that you would see over there is that the military situation, without question, our brave men and women are doing incredible work  over there. It's amazing to see firsthand the men and women in action and seeing the great things that they have been able to do with the situation that they have been presented with in Iraq.    But I cannot say the same thing about the politicians in Baghdad, the Iraqi politicians. We have had for several months now, if not more than a year, a situation in Baghdad where the politicians have just refused to step up and make the necessary political accommodations to administer their own government and run their own affairs. This situation in Iraq can only be resolved by the Iraqis themselves. It is their country. Our brave men and women in the military have provided a bubble of security around Baghdad to give the decisionmakers, the Iraqis in Baghdad the opportunity to make the tough political accommodations that are necessary, and they have refused to do it.    What we have seen in recent weeks, unfortunately, is the situation in Iraq regress. We will hold judgment on that until I hear from General Petraeus next week and Ambassador Crocker and hear what they have to say. But it does not appear that the situation in Iraq over the past several weeks has gotten any more stable. I hope that General Petraeus has good news.    But nobody can argue that our brave men and women in the military, the best and brightest this country has to offer, have done everything they can possibly do to give the Iraqis the opportunity to take the reins of power and control their own affairs and manage their own destiny. Unfortunately, it appears that they have refused to do so, the politicians in Baghdad. So we will certainly talk more about that.    I also wanted to touch on the economic downturn that we are in. There's a lot of debate on what you call it; is it a recession, are we in a recession, or are we not. I really don't care what we call it, what I know about is when I go back to my district in western Pennsylvania and I talk with people who are struggling in this economy, I can see firsthand what has happened and what the impact of this economic downturn has had on my constituents in southwestern Pennsylvania. We hear stories from all around the country of families going through the same trouble and turmoil as my constituents are in western Pennsylvania.    One of the things I hear over and over again is, well, these are just people who bought too much house. They got in over their heads and they bought more house than they can afford. You know what, they are getting what is coming to them.    That is not what happened. What we have had is people all across this country that have a mortgage, but they also have health care costs.        They have kids in school, where they are paying college tuition that is going up three and four and five times the rate of inflation. They have perhaps businesses to run. They have costs with fuel and gas prices and everything that that affects, with food prices going up.    Perhaps they took out a second mortgage, and maybe then they got overextended because they couldn't afford their daily household expenses because of everything else happening in the economy. This wave came on, and we had over 1 million foreclosures last year. We are on schedule this year to perhaps double that in 2008.    And I don't think anyone can argue that the economy is certainly in trouble right now. It is in a downward spiral, and we are hoping to prevent a recession, if we are not in one already. But I think to have an argument, as we have had on this floor many times with people on the other side who want to deny that this is a recession or not, that is missing the boat. I don't care what you call it. What I want to do is get out there and make a difference for the American people in a way that is going to make their life better and help them pay their daily household expenses and avoid bankruptcy and avoid defaulting on their mortgage. And that helps everybody.    Perhaps you do say, well, these are people who bought too much house and they got what they deserve. Even that is not the case. If those people live in your neighborhood and they default on their mortgage and their house is foreclosed, guess what? That is going to hurt your property values. That is going to have a direct impact on you, and maybe at that point you might take a second look at it. I don't want it to get to that point. I want to take proactive action.    The President this week, when he talked about what his economic plan was he was moving forward, it sounded a lot like Herbert Hoover and what his plan was in the 1930s. And if you sit on your hands and you do nothing, I can promise you, this is not going to correct itself. This problem is going to continue to get worse.    So I am grateful that we have come here tonight to talk about these important issues and to take action on these issues as a Congress, because working together we can take a giant step in solving these problems for the American people, hopefully avoiding a recession, if we are not in one, but in the long term making policy decisions that are going to directly improve the lives of our constituents all across the country.    With that, I would now yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Clarke). Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - April 02, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I thank the gentleman from Ohio. I wanted to think  about this in the terms of what this Congress has done to resolve some of the issues that we are talking about right now for our brave service men and women and their families. Because anyone listening to this debate would say, well, that is great that you are talking about what the problems are; but what have you done to solve the problems? And I want to tell anyone who is willing to listen that we have a tremendous record of accomplishment in supporting our troops. Not just saying the words, but supporting the troops with our actions, not just our words. And we are in the sixth year of the war in Iraq right now, and here are some things that this new Congress has done, bills that have been signed into law to address the issues that we are talking about.    The gentleman from Ohio talks about traumatic brain injury and the incredible impact that has had. TBI is the signature injury of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, because people who would have been killed in previous wars, thanks to better medical technology and better armor and equipment, thankfully they survive; but, unfortunately, in many cases they are horrifically injured, the type of injuries the gentleman witnessed at Walter Reed. I took a trip to Walter Reed, myself, and I saw the same types of injuries, the lost limbs, the spinal cord injuries and the traumatic brain injuries.    But what happens is, when these men and women come back and they are still in the Defense health care system, they are treated for the apparent physical injuries that you can see in front of you. And because they are moving so quickly, they don't think to screen them for TBI if it is not a severe case of TBI. They move them over to the VA. The VA has no record of them having had a head injury, so it doesn't become part of their medical record and we have symptoms that go undiagnosed the rest of the time they are in the VA health care facility.    So what this Congress did is said that every VA facility in this country has to have somebody on staff who is equipped and trained to treat traumatic brain injury, and we created a national data base for all of those cases where we establish treatment protocols to make sure that those brave men and women who suffered from TBI get the highest quality care anywhere in the country. That is something that is going to directly impact people's lives.    Because of that law that we passed in this House and that has been signed into law, every veteran who enters a VA health care facility is going to be screened for traumatic brain injury, so never again will it go undiagnosed. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - April 02, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I thank the gentleman for that clarification, because that is instructive when we do hear from the other side, the unproductivity alleged of this Congress.    How about this. The gentleman from Florida talked about the tremendous strain, as did the gentlewoman from New York, the tremendous strain our families of our men and women who are in the Guard and Reserve that are being deployed not once, not twice, but multiple redeployments, four, even five times now as we head into the sixth year of the war in Iraq, and we have been in Afghanistan since before that. So these families are left behind, and they have to struggle just to make ends meet.    What has this Congress done about it? We are being told on the other side we haven't done anything, we don't have any record. Well, let me tell you what this Congress has done about it. This has been signed into law.    We expanded the Family and Medical Leave Act for the first time to cover the families of our military Guard and Reserve, people who are putting their lives on the line for us with multiple redeployment overseas. And now, because of the action in this Congress, you can use Family and Medical Leave Act time to care for a wounded service man or woman when they come back, to use time to reassimilate as a family, to get to know your kids again and get to know your spouse again after being away for 15 months. And while they are gone, the spouse can use that time to attend these deployment briefings that happen often during the workday and they can't get time off of work, they can use it for child care, they can use it to get their economic house in order and deal with the household finances, things that weren't covered before.    That is a law that is going to directly impact people's lives. It is going to make it a little bit easier for the families of our military Guard and Reserve, and that is something that we did in this Congress after the previous Congresses had done nothing to address the issue.    So, I do take offense to the comment that the gentleman from Ohio relayed that had been made about how we had done nothing. Mr. ALTMIRE. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 25, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues on the other side for their weeks of expressing to us what their concerns were about the SCHIP bills that we've passed. And I'm happy to say that we've heard  those concerns, and in this bill that we're voting on today we address those concerns.    They were concerned, as am I, about coverage for illegal immigrants. And this bill expressly prohibits coverage of illegal immigrants.    They were concerned about the coverage of adults, including adults who are currently covered in the SCHIP program. This bill eliminates coverage for those adults and all childless adults.    And they were concerned about income levels. They wanted to keep this program for low-income children, and this bill today caps at 300 percent of poverty the qualification level for families to get into the SCHIP program. So there should be no reason for any of my colleagues on the other side to vote against this bill.    Let's vote to ensure 10 million children receive the health care that they deserve. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Thank you. Same to you. I had a wonderful Father's Day with my two children, and I'm happy to be back on this Monday night. And I did want to add some levity to the evening, because people watch late night television. We're here; it's after 11:00. And the gentleman perfectly set me up by talking about the President's radio address. So I wanted to read a quote from the President's radio address that, for those that know history and for those that don't, I'm going to    remind them of some of the history. They're going to find this quote to be quite entertaining. And this is the President's radio address.    ``In the weeks ahead, my administration will continue pushing for earmark reform and holding the line on Federal spending. The American people do not want a return to the days of tax and spend policies. They expect accountability and fiscal discipline in Washington, D.C.''    Now, certainly, we don't disagree with that statement, but for those that understand the history of this administration, they can understand why some of us might be amused to hear the President saying such a thing, because I would remind my colleagues, if they need reminding, that prior to President Bush taking office, the 4 years immediately before his term, his first term, we had had 4 consecutive years of budget surplus, surpluses that were forecast as far as the eye can see.    In fact, the Congressional Budget Office scored the 10-year projection of surplus at over $5 trillion of surplus.    So President Bush comes into office, there's every reason to expect these surpluses are going to continue.    Well, what have we seen in the 6-plus years that this President has been this office? Well, we've seen six consecutive budget deficits, deficits that before the Democrats retook control of Congress, were forecast as far as the eye can see. And this has been the biggest spending administration in over the past 6 years before this year, the biggest spending Congresses in the history of this country.    So for the President to get on the radio and come before audiences and lecture the Democrats on fiscal responsibility, and I would re-read that last  statement on what he says the American people expect, ``They expect accountability and fiscal discipline in Washington, D.C.''    Well, over the course of that 6 years, the President added $3.5 trillion to the national debt. Now, keep in mind what I said earlier, that the projection before he took office was, over the 10-year period, we would have over $5 trillion in surplus. But, instead, in just 6 years, he had an $8 trillion turnaround, from $5 trillion on the plus side to $3 trillion on the deficit side.    And I would suggest, if you had said to an economist going into that term, figure out a way that this is possible, how can a President, using economic policy, working with the Republican-controlled Congress, have a $8 trillion swing from surplus to deficit, most economists would have said, oh, that's impossible. You can't possibly mismanage the economy in such a way that you could have that poor of an outcome. Well, unfortunately, we have.    So here, again, to have this President lecture this Congress on fiscal responsibility is simply inconsistent with the facts.    He also references earmarks in the appropriations process. And we do have Ms. Wasserman Schultz here, a member of the Appropriations Committee. And I know she will have something to say about this as well.    But I wanted to remind my colleagues about the history of the 12 years that the Republicans were in control of this House, from 1995 through 2006. Well, for that 12-year period, the 12 budget cycles that we had, I don't know if any of my colleagues would like to venture a guess, how many times in those 12 years do you think the Republican Congress finished the appropriations process on time? How many times were all the appropriations bills completed by October 1, which, under statute, is the beginning of the fiscal year?    The gentlewoman from Florida. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Zero times in 12 years. Now, interestingly, you'd say, well, it must be difficult to do then. Maybe it's not often that we're able to do this. Does the gentlewoman from Florida wish to venture a guess on the last time that the budgets were all completed on time and the appropriations were completed by October 1 in their entirety? Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Right. In the 1994 year, the Democratic Congress, the last year the Democrats controlled Congress, the Democrats were able to complete all the budget bills, all the appropriations bills on time. The last time it has happened. Then we had 12 years of Republican rule in this Congress, in this House, and we had 12 consecutive years where the appropriations bills were not completed on time.    So it should be no surprise to any of my colleagues and other outside observers that the Republicans are not anxious to see the Democrats come back into power and right away pass all 12 appropriations bills in a timely fashion. So I was not surprised, and I suspect others were not surprised, to see the extraordinary delaying tactics that we saw take place in this House last week, with continual and repeated procedural motions, motions to rise.    And those of us that sat here at 2 o'clock in the morning on that night, we realized that this was not about substance. This was not about policy. This was merely about denying the Democrats a legislative victory because the last thing those on the other side would want is for us to come in and right away pass the appropriations bills on time, which hasn't happened since 12 years ago when we last controlled Congress.    And, lastly, the President mentions earmarks. His quote again: ``In the weeks ahead, my administration will continue pushing for earmark reform.''    Well, what has been the history of earmarks under the Republican Congress? Let's go back to that 12-year period, and I know the gentlewoman knows the answer; so I will spare you the question this time. In 1994, that last year that the Democrats controlled Congress, there were 4,000 earmarks, approximately, in all the spending bills combined for $26 billion. That is what they represented. Now, that sounds like a lot and it is a lot. It is a lot of earmarks and it is a lot of money.    Well, let's compare that to last year, the last year the Republicans controlled Congress. These were the people, you recall, that last week were decrying the use of earmarks and talking about how unfair it was how the Democrats were approaching it, and we have a President now who says he is going to continue pushing for earmark reform, ``continue'' being the operative word there. Well, when you hear the word ``continue,'' let's thing think about what happened last year. Now, recall in 1994, 4,000 earmarks, $26 billion. Last year, 2006, 16,000 earmarks, unprecedented, the highest in the history of the country, $64 billion of earmarks, compared to $26 billion in 1994.    So here again, please spare us the lecture about fiscal responsibility and accountability in the appropriations process and certainly as it pertains to earmarks. We have had, over the past 6 years of this administration and over the past 12 years of Republican leadership in this Congress, the biggest-spending Congress and administration in the history of the country. They spent more money, they ran up bigger deficits, they used more earmarks for more money than any Congress and any administration in the history of the country. So please forgive me if I view with skepticism some of the President's comments over the weekend.    And at this time I will now turn it over to the gentlewoman from Florida. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. It means we as the Congress are doing the same thing the American people have to do in their own home. Checkbooks, you have to have money on one side of the ledger if you want to spend it on another. That is something this Congress has not done. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. On our very first day in Congress, it was this Congress that reinstated the pay-as-you-go. As a result, all of these appropriations bills that the President is threatening to veto, for the first time in 6 years, these appropriations bills are compliant with PAYGO. They say simply, as I said, you have to have money on one side to pay for it on the other. If you want to increase spending, or decrease revenue, for that matter, you have to find an offset to pay for it on the other side of the ledger. That is what the President is talking about vetoing.    Specific to the Homeland Security appropriations bill, which we passed last week, I just wanted to talk a little bit about immigration. Boy, we hear a lot about immigration, around the country on talk radio. I am sure each of you in your Florida districts hear about it. I can promise you in my Western Pennsylvania district, I hear more about immigration than I hear about any other issue, and there is not even a close second.    It is an important issue. It is an issue for a lot of people that we have illegal immigrants coming across the border. And for anyone who is talking about this Homeland Security bill that is concerned about that issue, I want to tell you that in this bill we have money for fencing.    The speaker before us had his prop out where he was showing about building a fence along the border. This bill has money to build the fence.    This bill has money for new technologies for detection of immigrants, illegal immigrants coming across the borders.    This bill has increased border agents and security agents that are able to enforce our laws, 3,000 new border agents along our southern border with Mexico.    It has new detention beds. We have a catch-and-release program where we don't have the capacity to hold on to folks that we are catching on the southern border, so we simply release them. This bill has money to stop that practice with new border agents and new detention beds.    So for anyone that is watching this debate that is concerned about immigration and thinks we need to secure the boarders, we agree, and we passed a bill to make that happen. That is the bill the President is threatening to veto.    We also have port and aviation security measures. We have a situation where as a result of 9/11 we have to be very concerned about our aviation security, certainly, and our port security. We have money in this bill to increase our security on both of those. That is what the President is threatening to veto.    We have increased the money available for first responders. The President cut by 55 percent firefighter funding. So anyone who is concerned about firefighters, can you think of a more worthy commitment for our Federal spending priorities than the brave men and women who put their lives on the line every single day here at home to keep us safe and are doing it on a voluntary basis through the fire department?    The President cut that funding by 55 percent in his budget. Well, we restored that, because our priorities say that we should find that money, and through pay-as-you-go we did find the money to pay for that. But we put that money back in for our firefighters and our police, our first responders.    Lastly, before I turn it over to Ms. Wasserman Schultz, who can speak as a member of the Appropriations Committee, this is so important. This bill ensures our tax dollars are spent wisely with the requirement for competitive bidding on contracts.    Now, anyone who has followed what happened in the Homeland Security arena over the past several years, and certainly that includes Katrina and the fiasco that took place with the no-bid contracts thereafter along the Gulf Coast, knows how important it is to ensure that our tax dollars are spent in a responsible and fiscally rational way.        We do that through the requirement that we do competitive bidding on contracts which has been in very short supply over the past 6 years.    So that is what is in this bill. We secure our borders. We put money into detection and prevention and detention of illegal immigrants. We secure our aviation, our airplanes and our airports. We secure our ports. We put money in for first responders. That is what the Homeland Security bill does, and that is what the President is threatening to veto. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I just want to remind our colleagues who are with us tonight and watching us tonight that this is about preventing the Democrats from a legislative victory. It is not about the budget because this is compliant with pay-as-you-go rules.    I was amused in listening to the gentlewoman from Florida when I thought about what one of the major Republican Presidential candidates said recently, ``The Democrats don't understand terrorism.'' The gentlewoman went through a very lengthy list of things that we have done here in the first 6 months on homeland security and on terrorism, and the fact that the President is threatening to veto many of those initiatives.    I would ask the question rhetorically, who among us, the Democrats or Republicans, don't understand terrorism? I think we are the ones putting forward initiative after initiative after initiative compliant with PAYGO rules to prevent terrorist attacks, as much as it is possible to do that, and to address these issues in a way that has not been done. It has languished for years.    The 9/11 Commission recommendations were put forward in 2003. Here we are 4 years later. September 11 took place nearly 6 years ago. We still have not implemented the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, and that is indefensible.    I would just say to anyone who says it is the Democrats who don't understand terrorism to take a look at the list that the gentlewoman has put forward that we have done in only 6 months after these initiatives have languished year after year.    Mr. Speaker, I tell my colleagues, for more information, if they would like to learn, of course you can go to Speaker.gov/30something, or there is now a link on the Speaker's Web site to the 30-something Working Group of which the three of us are members as well as Mr. Murphy and Mr. Ryan and others. So that site is www.speaker.gov, click on the 30-something icon and you can learn more about the issues and see the charts, even the gentleman's Velcro chart which is now missing. Mr. ALTMIRE. (LIVABLE PITTSBURGH -- (House of Representatives - May 09, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Madam Speaker, it is a true pleasure for me to stand here tonight to talk about my favorite city, the city of Pittsburgh, which was once again named by Rand McNally as America's ``most livable'' city.    Now, Rand McNally has been designating cities as livable for 26 years, and  Pittsburgh is the first city to ever repeat. We also won it in 1985. They do it every 4 years. And I can't tell you how happy I am to have this designation because this shows for the rest of the country and the rest of the world what we already know in Southwestern Pennsylvania, that Pittsburgh is a great place to live and work. And Rand McNally has done this through formula. And 379 cities are rated on nine categories: housing, transportation, jobs, education, climate, crime, health care, recreation and ambiance, which covers its being a great place to live and work and things to do.    Pittsburgh was in the top 30 percent in the housing category. It is 93 percent of the national average in the cost of living with regard to housing. In transportation, Pittsburgh's commute is 25 minutes to work one way. And I challenge the rest of my colleagues in some other areas of the country to match that. I know that it is frustrating during rush hour to find your way into work, and in Pittsburgh generally on most days you can get in relatively quickly.    The average house in Pittsburgh is 49 percent below the national average in cost at $112,000. So that is why we rank so high in housing. In jobs, Pittsburgh is in the top quarter there. For 100 years, it still is one of the Nation's top corporate centers as home to Fortune 500 companies: Alcoa, Heinz, Mellon, PNS, PPG, U.S. Steel, and WESCO International. We have more than 90 multi-billion dollar, global corporations that call the city of Pittsburgh home.    We have more than 2,000 acres of ready-to-go sites near our airport. We have the Nation's second busiest inland port with our three rivers and the waterways. And importantly, for the environmentally conscious, Pittsburgh has the most certified ``green'' buildings in the entire country.    In education, we are home to 34 colleges and universities, including Carnegie Mellon University, which always is ranked as one of the best in the entire Nation. We have four distinct seasons with 7 months that see sunshine 50 percent of the time. And I will admit that our winters can be tough, and that was probably not our strong suit, but we still were number one overall.    Pittsburgh in crime has the lowest crime rate of any of the top 25 cities in the entire country, and this is a consistent rating that Pittsburgh has finished strongly.    In health care, we are an international leader in medical research and innovation. We have a world class health care system. We are ranked 14th overall in the country and our children's hospital is ranked 11th in the entire country.    In recreation, we have five cities. We have three rivers that provide 38 miles of shoreline for recreational purposes such as fishing. And we have PNC Park for our baseball team, which has been rated consistently as the top baseball park in the country. We have a new Penguins arena scheduled to be built and a great young hockey team. And we have a football team that has now won five Super Bowls. So we have a lot of sports and recreation to do.    And in the performing arts, we have more performing arts concentrated in one area than any city in the country outside of New York City. It has been voted the second best cityscape in America, the view from the top of Mt. Washington in Pittsburgh. We have whitewater rafting and downhill skiing within 90 minutes. And we have a bike passage that goes all the way from the city of Pittsburgh to right here in Washington, D.C.    So, again, the fact that we were number one in Rand McNally for the second time did not surprise me, and it did not surprise the rest of the people in western Pennsylvania. But it might have come as a surprise to some other people around the country.    And I stand here tonight to tell my colleagues and anyone else that may be viewing tonight that Pittsburgh is a fantastic place to live and work, especially for young people. And we are doing a much better job now attracting and retaining a younger workforce, and we have shown through a variety of ways that we have young and dynamic leadership. Mr. ALTMIRE. (THE 30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - May 09, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I appreciate the gentleman from Connecticut, and I admire his leadership. I know that you did make that trip to Iraq and you came back and you can speak with some authority and some expertise, and I appreciate hearing from you. And I especially appreciate the opportunity to speak tonight on what is definitely the most important issue I think everyone would agree that we face.    I was struck by the fact that the gentleman mentioned third-party verification for different options and different opinions in Iraq. And what strikes me is the fact that the President of the United States has declined to listen to any third-party verification. He has delivered a loud and clear message last November that the American people called for change, not only domestically here in America but especially in Iraq. He has been told by his generals on the ground that he is not moving in the correct direction. He has been told by his advisers, before they're replaced, that he's not going in  the right way. The Iraq Study Group, as we all know, recommended the course of action that we have advocated; and the bill that he vetoed was verified by the Iraq Study Group.    The fact that he fails to listen to the American people, he fails to listen to his military advisers, he fails to listen to his White House advisers and he fails to listen to the Iraq Study Group, that demonstrates a clear decision on his part that he is going to ignore all of those opinions and continue down the same failed course.    I was dismayed today when I heard the news that 35,000 American troops have been told that they can expect to be sent to Iraq this fall and that their tour is going to last at least through the spring of 2008. Now, this is additional troops after the surge that we had been told in January was only going to last a few months and only going to be 21,000 troops. Now we're hearing an additional 35,000 troops and the surge is going to be at least 18 months instead of the 2 or 3 or 4 months that were we were initially led to believe.    But, thankfully, this Congress took clear and decisive action by sending the President a bill, which we have talked about before, that gives the troops the money that they need. It actually contains more money in funding for our troops on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan than the President requested, and that bill was met with a veto, as we know.    I had someone come up to me over the weekend and say, well, when are you going to get our troops the money that they need? And I said, we sent the President a bill that does exactly that. It was the President's decision to veto that bill and delay this process and, most importantly, delay the funding for our troops.    So the fact that he now came out and made a statement today that if we sent him a bill, that is, we took out all the things that he talked about that he doesn't like, it is not going to have the timelines and the things that he used as his reason for vetoing it the first time, we are going to send him a bill that gives the troops the funding that they need to get them through the next several months, and it is actually going to again be more funding than he asked for for the period of time that we are going to send him the money for, and we    were told today that is going to be met with a veto.    So I am exasperated to hear this, because I want the troops to get the money and the funding and all the equipment and resources that they need to continue the brave fight that Mr. Murphy from Connecticut was talking about and that he witnessed firsthand. But we can't do that alone. We need the President to sign the bill that we sent him.    Tomorrow, we are going to vote on our second bill after the veto; and we are going to send it to the White House. I hope that the President will reconsider his decision to delay the funding that our troops in the field need, because these are the bravest and brightest Americans. These are people who are putting their lives on the line. They are giving every sacrifice. They are leaving their families back home for extended periods of time, multiple tours. And we are giving them the money that is required, but the President is delaying the process. So I share the frustrations of the gentleman from Connecticut.    At this time, I will yield to the gentlewoman from Florida, our fearless leader with the 30-Something Working Group, Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Mr. ALTMIRE. (THE 30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - May 09, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, I think the gentlelady has touched on that issue in a way that makes sense to most onlookers. She comes from a State that has seen problems. But we saw as a nation what happened in New Orleans in 2005 and the lack of response that took place in large part because of these issues that we are talking about, because the Guard and the Reserve that would usually be called upon to address those issues and come to the aid of the victims of that hurricane were deployed or otherwise engaged.    We have a National Guard and Reserve that has been the subject of multiple deployments now, often three, four deployments. And when we have a situation like unfortunately happened in Kansas recently, we see the result. The Guard and Reserve is over deployed, and we are not able to respond in the fashion we need to respond when we have a national emergency, such as we saw in Kansas.    I wanted, if it is okay with the gentleman from Connecticut, to switch the topic to gas prices, because I realized as I was looking at the gentlewoman from Florida, there may be some viewers who are wondering what that apparatus is that is next to her. It is a gas pump. I will let her talk about that momentarily.    But I just wanted to start the ball rolling on that discussion and read you a quote from the President of the United States from July of 2001. So we are going back 6 years now. This is what the President said: ``My administration has proposed a plan that will reduce America's reliance on foreign oil.'' Six years ago.    For those who are interested in the success or lack thereof of that statement: In 2002, this Nation got 58 percent of its oil from foreign sources. That was our dependence. In the year 2006, last year, that number had risen to 66 percent.     Here you have a President who says that it is one of his priorities to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. We went from 58 percent in his first full year in office to 66 percent last year, and it is exponential growth, just a chart that goes straight up. So I would say that his philosophy has not worked as well as perhaps he would have hoped.    What is most disappointing to me is I sat here for my first State of the Union address as a Member of Congress, and I listened to the President go on for quite some time about energy independence and the need to reduce our dependence and reliance on foreign oil. I was encouraged by that. This was still my first month in office, and I thought, this is a President that has finally seen the light and was going to move in that direction.    But, unfortunately, I went back and I reread some of his previous State of the Union addresses, and I realized that he has made that claim multiple times over the years of his administration. And instead of seeing a diminishment of our reliance on foreign oil source, it is growing exponentially.    So it is frustrating to me to see the lack of attention to what is the first issue domestically that I hear about when I go back to my district, and I am sure    the gentlelady from Florida and the gentleman from Connecticut have the same questions bestowed upon them when they go back to their districts, why are gas prices so high, and what are you doing about it?    Well, this Congress is taking steps to do something about it. After years of coddling the big oil companies and giving them taxpayer subsidies in the billions of dollars at a time when they are making all-time record profits for any industry in the history of the country, we have finally decided we are going to pull back on those subsidies and redirect them to alternative sources of energy, to research and development of a myriad of sources of energy, to get us off of our dependence on foreign oil, something the President said was his priority 6 years ago, but nothing was done about it.    So this Congress is going to use that money for research and development to grow us out of this problem through research and development.    I yield back to the gentleman from Connecticut, who has a chart that illustrates what has happened to gas prices since this President first took office. Mr. ALTMIRE. (THE 30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - May 09, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I don't mean to interrupt the gentleman, but I did want to remind anyone who is observing this discussion tonight that the ``Six for '06'' was the Democratic mantra moving forward and going into the election. Ms. Wasserman Schultz was here for that discussion, and Mr. Murphy and I were out on the campaign trail. And we talked a lot about gas prices and taking on big oil for the first time in many years and revoking some of these subsidies and redirecting them. That was a key staple of this six policy issues that the Democrats made as their top priority for that election cycle and for the first 100 hours in Congress after we were able to retake the Congress.    The gentleman talks about the sequence of events that, as that discussion was brought out, it became pretty clear to everybody that this was going to be a change. This was going to be a new direction for the country.    Again, I am just saying that, as the gentleman is, it is an amazing coincidence that just as that proposal comes forward and just as the momentum starts to shift and look like the Democrats have a chance to promote this agenda in the majority for the first time in 12 years, we do see an incredible drop in gas prices. I think it went down something like 80 cents over a several week period leading up to the election. Now, as you said, it is back up to record levels here shortly thereafter.    I did not mean to interrupt. Mr. ALTMIRE. (THE 30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - May 09, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. The gentlewoman from Florida listed off a number of initiatives that this Democratic Congress has taken at long last to address the gas price crisis that we are facing in this country. We are going to move with great speed to address these issues. We are going to address the price-gouging situation. We are going to address alternative sources of energy. We are going to address the environmental impact of the choices and the long-term consequences. We will address the price of gas that we see at pumps every day, similar to the one that the gentlewoman was holding up.    But I want to remind everybody, which is obvious because we are having this Iraq debate now and the President has sent one bill back with a veto and may send a second bill back with a veto, that we, because of the Constitution, can't do it ourselves. This is a divided government that we have, and we need the assistance of the people on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue down at the White House to join us in this effort to make a national priority of lowering the gas prices and addressing this issue for the first time since this President took office.    I don't see any indication that he is willing to do that. We can pass legislation, we can have committee hearings and oversight and talk all that we want, but if we are not joined in this effort by our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, and especially the President, we are going to be unable to address this issue in a way that is satisfactory to the American people.    I would urge my colleagues to voice their opinion that this is a priority. It is important to their constituents, and we do need to have a bipartisan effort moving forward to do this because this is an important issue. These are big topics that we are trying to pursue, and we need a unified American people and a unified body to take the initiative to the President and hopefully work with him on a positive solution. Mr. ALTMIRE. (THE 30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - May 09, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. We only have about a minute and a half left, and Mr. Murphy is going to do the wrap-up.    I just wanted to say that I see this prop that we have here, and it reminds me of, Mr. Murphy and I were watching you and Mr. Meek and Mr. Ryan last year with that big oil rubber stamp that you kept bringing around. Thankfully, we were able to retire that rubber stamp because the American people voted for a change in direction. I hope it is not going to take 18 months for us to retire that prop, that we are going to take clear and decisive action here in Congress, as I know we will under the Speaker's a leadership, and we are going to be able to do something about the gas prices in a way that is going to allow us to retire your prop there. But we are going to do our part, and I am going to send it over now to Mr. Murphy. Mr. ALTMIRE. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this bill, which gives the HHS Secretary the ability to negotiate group discounts with drug companies.    I have to admit that I am amazed that we are even having this debate. How could anyone possibly oppose negotiating group discounts to reduce the cost of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries? We already do it in the VA, and it has worked. Why not allow Medicare beneficiaries the same savings? I can't believe anyone would oppose such a measure. I find it absurd that Congress would prevent a Federal agency from exploring ways to reduce costs for seniors and save the American taxpayers money.    The truth is, Mr. Speaker, that this bill would lower the cost of prescription drugs for seniors and save money for the American taxpayers. I urge my colleagues to side with our Nation's Medicare beneficiaries and support this bill. Mr. ALTMIRE. (COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY AND AFFORDABILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Chairman, I want to take a moment to highlight a few aspects of this bill that I worked to include. During committee consideration of the bill, I offered and passed an amendment to encourage colleges and employers to form partnerships that identify high-demand occupations and create educational pathways for students to pursue them.    These partnerships will help students succeed in the job market and provide local businesses with the skilled workers they need to grow. This bill also includes my legislation that requires the Department of Education to forgive the student loans of veterans who are determined to be totally and permanently disabled by the VA.    This will end the duplicative and burdensome process that disabled veterans currently must endure. It also includes my legislation to provide grants for teacher preparation courses at minority-serving institutions to help them recruit and prepare the teachers of tomorrow.    This legislation will expand our teaching pipeline and improve the diversity of our Nation's teachers and teaching force. The College Opportunity and Affordability Act significantly improves our higher education system, and I encourage my colleagues to support it. Mr. ALTMIRE. (COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY AND AFFORDABILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Chairman, over the past 20 years, the average price of textbooks has nearly tripled. College students now spend $1,000 a year on textbooks, and for some majors it can be up to $2,000. This dramatic rise in textbook prices is a significant contributor to the increase in overall cost of college education. To remedy this, I'm offering this amendment today with Congressman Ryan. Our amendment creates a pilot program to award 10 competitive grants to establish rental textbook programs.    Rental programs could reduce textbook expenses by up to 75 percent. A recent report by the Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance highlighted textbook rental programs as a way to significantly reduce textbook expenses. The same report noted that the primary obstacle to these programs is the start-up costs associated with implementing them.    The Ryan-Altmire amendment will enable institutions to create textbook rental programs and, as a result, save students money. I encourage all of my colleagues to support it. And I thank the gentleman from Niles, Ohio, for allowing me to attach my name to his amendment. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida, and I'm glad the chart is up today and our colleagues are able to look at that.    Those are the six items that we identified as our top six legislative priorities for the 110th session of Congress and starting with the very first day, January 4, 2007. So, going back more than a year, we began work on these projects. And as the gentlewoman pointed out, four of the six have become law. They've been signed into law by President Bush. All four of them passed with strong bipartisan support. The other two that did not become law, both passed the House. In the case of stem cell research, it passed the House twice and it passed the Senate twice and was vetoed by the President twice. Unfortunately, we were unable to override the veto. The Medicare prescription drugs, that failed in the Senate. But all six of these passed the House with strong bipartisan support. Four of them have been enacted into law.    I'm glad to hear about the stimulus package, too. That was the vote that we cast today. And I'm very excited with the quick response that this House and the Senate gave to the American people. We worked together in a bipartisan way to address the problems with the economy. Just about any economist that you talk to, bipartisan, across the spectrum, will say that we are in great danger of slipping into a recession if we are not already in a recession.    So coming back at the very beginning of the year, working together, the first week back, we put together the stimulus package. We passed it out of the House. We sent it to the Senate. They took a little bit longer, but they got their work done, and I congratulate them for that. They passed it today, sent it over to us. We immediately passed it out of the House, and now we are going to send it on to the President.    And this is a stimulus package that is directly going to impact people's lives. This is a tax rebate that is going to put money in the hands of consumers who are going to spend it. And I know we are going to talk in some more detail about that. I will leave that discussion for after Mr. Murphy speaks.    But I did want to point out the issue that we are talking about is bipartisanship. We came back from the holidays, saw the need, heard from the economists, and immediately sprung into action, put together a package in a bipartisan way. Got it done. Both sides of this Capitol. Now we are sending it to the President.    The reason this is so important is because of some of the issues that Ms. Wasserman Schultz was talking about. The subprime mortgage issue that we all have heard so much about. One of the issues that people need to think about among our colleagues is that when you think about mortgages that are unable to be paid and foreclosures taking place with the subprime mortgages, in many cases this is not a case of somebody buying too much house, buying a house they can't afford, being unable to pay their mortgage. Certainly that does happen.    The bulk of these mortgages that go bad in the foreclosures that take place are second mortgages. There are people who are unable to pay their bills because of rising gas prices, because of rising health care prices, because of higher education costs. They're simply unable to make ends meet. They take out a second mortgage to pay their daily expenses and unfortunately get in over their heads and lose their homes as a result.    So this stimulus package, by putting money into the hands of people who are going to be able to use it to pay bills and stimulate the economy and buy merchandise and hopefully get the economy kick-started again and prevent a recession, or at least lessen the impact of a recession if we are already in one, this is a very important piece of legislation that both the House and the Senate passed today. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I would say, Ms. Wasserman Schultz, not to interrupt, but the President did tell us last year that he was going to reduce the deficit, and I see here that last year we had a $410 billion deficit. And he did, in fact, reduce it. Let's give credit where credit is due. The deficit this year is only going to be $407 billion. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I'm being facetious, obviously. A $407 billion deficit for 1 year is a very significant deficit, third highest ever submitted behind only the budget he submitted last year and the budget from 2004.    But I really appreciate the gentlewoman giving us a little walk down memory lane because we're in a Presidential election year this year, so people are thinking about Presidential politics. And I like to remind my colleagues to think back to the 2000 Presidential election, and let's remember what the discussion was at that time. The Clinton administration was wrapping up. We're in our fourth consecutive year of budget surplus at that time. And as the gentlewoman pointed out with the previous chart, those surpluses were forecast as far as the eye could see, $5.6 trillion forecasted deficit over 10 years. So the discussion during the Presidential election in the year 2000 between Vice President Gore and then-Governor Bush was, what are we going to do with all this money? This is an incredible surplus. We're awash in money. Are we going to shore up the Social Security trust fund? Are we going to pay down the debt? What are we going to do with this money?    Well, now it's 8 years later, and unfortunately we are not having that discussion anymore, because instead of having had a $5.6 trillion surplus, as the gentlewoman pointed out, we have had a $3.5 trillion deficit over just the past 7 years. So that $5.5 trillion surplus was a 10-year projection, $3.5 trillion over 7 years. And as the gentlewoman points out, that's almost a $9 trillion swing.    And I often ask, when we discuss the budget, if you had said to an economist or any group of economists after the new administration took over and they were facing this $5.5 trillion surplus, if you had said, well, what would it take to have a $9 trillion swing to the negative in the surplus to a deficit, just about any economist you talk to would have said, well, that's impossible. You can't possibly mismanage the economy to such an extent that you would have a $9 trillion swing over just 7 years. Well, unfortunately, this current administration has done the impossible; they have added $3.5 trillion to the national debt, which now stands at $9.2 trillion. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Murphy, I would like to direct a question to our colleague from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz). She has been here for two terms now, we've been here for one, so I'm going to ask her a question. Maybe she can enlighten us and anyone else that may be listening.    What are the nations that we're talking about here when we're talking about foreign-held debt? What are some of the countries that we are lending this money to? Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. And I know that the gentlewoman is going to talk about this next issue, and Mr. Murphy and I talked last night at great length about the fact that the second largest line item on the budget that the President submitted to us on Monday, the second largest line item in a $3.1 trillion budget that is literally a foot thick page by page is interest on the national debt. The Pentagon budget is first, and interest on the debt is second. I believe the gentlewoman has a chart showing it's approximately $240 billion, just interest, on the national debt.    So when you think about that $407 billion deficit for 1 year that the President submitted to us, more than half of that is due solely to interest on the debt that he has accumulated over the last 7 years. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, I wanted to talk a little bit about the chart that Ms. Wasserman Schultz was referencing and still has up. It shows the interest on the national debt and how that account dwarfs spending on education, veterans, and homeland security. But the truly sad part of that chart is that the red bar that shows net interest on the national debt is growing exponentially while the President, in the budget he submitted to us, slashes funding for education, for veterans, and for homeland security. And Mr. Murphy and I went over this a little bit last night in our talk on that 30-Something Group. But I just wanted to talk about those three accounts, education, veterans, and homeland security, and talk about what the President has decided to do.    Instead of investing in innovation in the classroom, his budget eliminates the $260 million program providing grants to States for classroom technology and freezes the $179 million mathematics and science partnerships. Now, that's a program that's targeted at improving achievement in math and science. And instead of making college more affordable, something that this House took a giant step towards doing just today, the President's budget inexplicably eliminates supplemental education opportunity grants. And the Perkins loan program, one of the staples of higher education assistance in this country, the President eliminates it in his budget. He also eliminates the Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnership program, the LEAP program that we know about. And they all provide necessary funding for needy students. His budget also eliminates funding for vocational education. This is completely unjustified.    We talked about homeland security, something that's very important to every Member of this House. Well, the President's budget slashes funding for State Homeland Security Grant Programs. And I would repeat that. I'm speaking correctly. It slashes funding for State Homeland Security Grant Programs at a time when we're at war. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. And, Mr. Murphy, you're leaving out one of the key facts, that they live in a world where you can charge everything to the national credit card. Everything that you do, every expense of the Federal Government, just charge it to the credit card, and that bill is never going to come due.    Well, guess what? That bill has come due. And the reason we're facing a recession right now is because we have been living through that fiscally irresponsible time. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. And it's particularly frustrating to Mr. Murphy and I, who are in our first term and we had our second State of the Union address just last week, a week ago, and the President of the United States stood right behind where I am standing right now and said to the Congress you need to be more fiscally responsible. And he lectured us on how he perceived this Congress to have been fiscally irresponsible. And literally a week later, 1 week later to the day, he drops on all of our desks a budget that is out of balance by $407 billion. So when you talk about living in a world where you can say one thing and do another, I would suggest you look no further than that budget that was submitted to us.    And the gentlewoman asked about the COPS program, and I appreciate her bringing that to our attention. I had in front of me funding for something that's near and dear to my heart, and that's for veterans, which was the third category on the chart that she showed several minutes ago when we talked about education funding and other accounts that pale in comparison to interest on the national debt. I just wanted to talk about what the President's budget does for veterans. It cuts health care for veterans by $20 billion over 5 years and cuts funds for constructing, renovating, and rehabilitating medical care facilities in the year 2009.    And I would remind everybody what happened at Walter Reed, which is a defense health care facility, last year, at about this time last year, when we heard reports of substandard living conditions and paint peeling and rodents. And we are then going to look at the VA, according to the President's budget, and actually cut funds for constructing, renovating, and rehabilitating medical care facilities at a time when we've had a national scandal at one of those facilities? I think that's disgraceful.    And for the 6th year in a row, the President's budget raises health care costs on 1 1/2 million veterans by imposing $5.2 billion in increased co-payments on prescription drugs and new enrollment fees for veterans.     Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I can't think of a group that we should be helping more than our Nation's veterans. And to have a budget submitted to us at a time when all of us can agree that there is nothing more important than taking care of the people who are putting their lives on the line for us, wearing the uniform of the United States every single day, making every possible sacrifice, and to have a budget submitted to us that slashes funding for veterans programs is an offense. It literally is an offense. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I want to talk about a few things that the President is leaving behind as he leaves office going into next year, and we look forward to working with him certainly throughout this year, $400 billion in annual deficits, deficits as far as the eye can see, as Mr. Murphy talked about, an exploding debt burden, a slowing economy; and this is something that I think really needs to be talked about because we had in January a net loss of 17,000 lost jobs. And there was a lot of talk in the administration about how, well, this was the first loss in 4 years in job growth in a month, which is true.    Now, any economist will tell you, anyone who studies these issues will tell you that because of the population growth in the country that works, we are experiencing in any given month, it takes between 100 and 150,000 new jobs being created just to keep pace with the increase in population growth in the country. So just to maintain, you have to have at minimum 100,000 new jobs. Well, many of the months that we are talking about going back 4 years, we have had much fewer jobs created per month than 100,000. And in fact, this administration, if you look at the job growth that has taken place over the 7-plus years of this administration and pro rate it, this is the weakest record of job growth in any administration since the Hoover administration. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Right. And Mr. Murphy held up his chart with all the Presidents on it and talked about big spenders and fiscally irresponsible people, and I think Mr. Hoover may not be remembered in those categories, but he is certainly not going to be remembered as a job creator, let's put it that way. So for this administration to have the worst record of job creation since the Hoover administration, I think really spells out the failure of these economic policies. Mr. ALTMIRE. (THE ECONOMY -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I would like to thank the gentleman from Maine for his leadership on this issue. This is a critical issue.    And you mentioned a lot of us are freshmen, like the gentleman from Iowa, who are just coming off the campaign trail from a few months back. And I come from a district in western Pennsylvania, just north of Pittsburgh, and I have six counties going along, three of them go along the Ohio line, and the other ones go just north of Pittsburgh. And I would think you would be hard pressed to find a district in this country that has seen more damage done by the global marketplace than Pittsburgh over the past 30 or 40 years, and more recently over the past dozen or 15 years since NAFTA was passed in 1993.    And just for some historical perspective for what I am going to talk about, and I know you have mentioned it already, the country as a whole lost three million manufacturing jobs since NAFTA was agreed to in 1993. And that is one out of every six manufacturing jobs that existed in this country at that time. I don't think we can draw any other conclusion but that that was not beneficial to this country and had the effect of job loss. I mean, it is self-evident.    Now, manufacturing jobs are disappearing in Pennsylvania as well. We can trace about 100,000 jobs lost in Pennsylvania as a direct result of NAFTA. And of course when you get into indirect result, that number is much higher.    Now, there has been a loss of 210,000 manufacturing jobs total, 24 percent decrease in the State of Pennsylvania over just the past 6 years. That is total. That is not just NAFTA. That is all these trade agreements. So we have lost a quarter of our manufacturing jobs in just the past 6 years.    Now, in my district just last week, this has unfortunate significance that just last week we lost 85 workers from Wheatland Tube, a large manufacturing plant in my district; 85 workers were released on February 26. And this is just the latest in a series of downsizing that has taken place there.    And I would put in a mention of Congressman Tim Ryan from Youngstown, who is very involved in this issue as well. And he came over to Wheatland Tube with me during the campaign, and we met with some of the workers and the leadership there at that time, and they expressed their concerns about China and their inability to compete in a fair way with what is happening in China. And here we see only a few months later that 85 workers have now lost their jobs as a result of what is happening.    And I would mention this quote from the vice president from Wheatland Tube last week. He said, ``We are not seeing relief from Chinese imports, and we are not going to sit around and wait for that relief. We need to right-size the company.'' And this is just one example.    Again, I have six counties in western Pennsylvania, and we are seeing this certainly all over the district and all over western Pennsylvania. But right there at Wheatland Tube, unfortunately, it hit home just last week.    Now, the onslaught of foreign subsidized goods that are illegally dumped in the U.S. is just one of the many problems that we are seeing that has not been addressed by this administration. And certainly these trade agreements are doing nothing about this. And the administration that has put forward CAFTA and some of the other more recent trade agreements continues down the same path.    And I can tell you that, with the possible exception of health care, there was no issue over the 18 months I spent on the campaign trail that came up more often and was of greater concern than these trade agreements in western Pennsylvania. So the American people have spoken on this issue. I can tell you, for sure, they spoke in my district, and I know they spoke in Mr. Braley's district. And we are going to hear from Congresswoman Sutton later and Mr. Ellison as well.    I think this is an issue whose time has come. It cannot be ignored any longer. These trade agreements have been detrimental to America. And none of us are saying we should bury our heads in the sand and ignore the global marketplace. What we are saying, as Mr. Hare eloquently put it earlier, is that we need to have trade agreements that represent fair trade. And fair trade means having the trading partner make some effort, at least an effort, to come into compliance with environmental laws, with workers' rights, certainly child labor laws. These are things that have been completely left out of these trade agreements. So we find ourselves just giving away the store and shipping those jobs overseas, as Dr. Kagen's chart so eloquently illustrated. Mr. ALTMIRE. (THE ECONOMY -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Well, in a word, it has been devastating, and we have seen the results. I talked about Wheatland Tube. I grew up about 100 miles from that plant, in a river town that was across from a big Allegheny Ludlam plant, which is where all the families worked. If you lived in that town, that is where you worked. And, unfortunately, things have not gone so well over the past couple of decades, both at that plant and another Allegheny Ludlam plant that I have in my district, and much of it has to do with these foreign trade issues. And as a result, now, when you travel through these communities, they used to be so vibrant and had a downtown that you could go through and it was hustle and bustle and there was activity. A lot of them now are ghost towns because we have seen the impact and the job loss that has resulted from the downfall of the steel industry 20 and 30 years ago, but more recently, the other heavy manufacturing that has been shipped overseas.        So it has been devastating to these communities, and you would only need to take one drive through much of my district to see the impact, because you can see the remnants of some of those plants. In many cases, they have been razed, and it is a brownfield site. But you can see the difference, and you can imagine what it used to be like 30 and 40 years ago and, in many cases, more recently.    I was just going to wrap up my portion by talking about what is coming next before us. And, again, none of us oppose the idea of trade. Fair trade is beneficial to both parties by definition. That is what we are talking about. But as the administration puts forward the Peruvian Trade Agreement, Colombia, Panama, and certainly fast track renewal, which the gentleman from Maine was talking about, we need to consider the fact that Congress, Representatives of the people, need to play an active role in these trade agreements. And, unfortunately, that has not been the case, which is why we have ended up with such one-sided agreement. So, as we consider those issues with Peru and Colombia and Panama and Presidential fast-track authority, I for one am going to support the working Americans of this country for fair trade practices. Mr. ALTMIRE. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Madam Speaker, in the lead-up to the war in Iraq, the President offered the American people many reasons why we should enter into this conflict. We were told unequivocally that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction and posed an imminent threat to the United States. We have since learned that pre-war intelligence was completely inaccurate.    We were told that proceeds from Iraq's oil reserves would pay for the cost of the war. Instead, the American people have paid for the cost of the  war. So far, $400 billion, with an additional supplemental request of $100 billion pending.    We were told that we would be greeted as liberators. Nothing could be further from the truth. More than 3,000 American troops have been killed, more than 23,000 injured, and violence in Iraq continues to escalate. There are over 900 weekly attacks on U.S. troops.    These predictions were in the past, but they are instructive as we consider the President's current predictions on how to achieve success in Iraq.    The American people have expressed their clear frustration with the conduct of the war. The bipartisan Iraq Study Group offered a comprehensive strategy to successfully move combat forces out of Iraq. High-level military leaders, including General John Abizaid, have expressed opposition to an escalation of troops. But the President continues to ignore public opinion, rejects sound advice, and stubbornly adhere to his failed go-it-alone policies.    He says he wants a bipartisanship study; but when his results are not to his liking, he dismisses it. He says he wants to hear from his advisers; but when they disagree with them, he dismisses them. He says he wants to hear from his generals on the ground; but when they tell him what he doesn't want to hear, they are reassigned.    The fact is, Madam Speaker, the President's plan to escalate the war in Iraq is not a new policy, just more of the same failed policy.    The solution in Iraq requires the Iraqis themselves to reach a political solution and take responsibility for their own government. The continued open-ended commitment of U.S. forces only deters the Iraqis from making the appropriate political decisions, training security forces, and enacting the reforms necessary to achieve stability.    The Iraq war resolution before us today is simple and straight forward. Let me explain what it does and what it doesn't do.    First and foremost, this resolution expresses our continued support for our military men and women who are serving bravely and honorably. It also expresses the sense of Congress that we disapprove of the decision made by the President to send additional troops to Iraq.    So make no mistake, this resolution is in support of our troops. Anyone who says otherwise is simply wrong. No Member of this House, Republican or Democrat, wants anything less than victory in Iraq and to support our troops.    This resolution does not affect the funding levels to carry out the war. And on that point, let me be clear. As long as we have troops in the field of battle and brave Americans in harm's way, I will never vote to withhold their funding.    I support this resolution because we have the duty as representatives of the American people to continue to voice their opinion that, with his policy of escalation, the President is heading down the wrong path.    The best way forward is for the President to work with Congress, to change course, and adopt a responsible strategy that protects American interests in Iraq, around the region, and at home.    I urge every Member of this House on both sides of the aisle to heed the call for change and vote for this resolution. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I greatly appreciate the gentleman from Florida yielding his time, and I just want to say to start, I think that the gentleman is, unfortunately, kidding himself when he says that he is not an entertaining speaker. He says we're not here for entertaining purposes.    You're selling yourself short, I would say to the gentleman, Mr. Speaker, because he is somebody who can be a very entertaining speaker. So don't sell yourself short on that. We do have some fun here, but we do get to the facts.    The facts are that the price of gas has gone down a little bit over the recent week, week and a half, and we are going to talk about why that has happened. But it's hit an all-time high over the last several weeks. We as a Congress have taken action. We have brought legislation to the floor to address this issue and specifically dealing with drilling, we have brought legislation to the floor to encourage the big oil companies to drill on the 86 million acres of land, 91 million acres of land, that is already ready to go, approved by Congress. Sixty-eight million of those acres are already leased, permitted, ready to go, owned by the oil companies. There is no reason why they can't start the process of surveying, doing the geological work, getting down to the business of drilling here and drilling now. Like the slogan says, there is no reason why they can't do that.    The other 20 million acres plus are in an area of Alaska outside of ANWR. We're going to talk about ANWR, and this area is called the National Petroleum Reserve. That's the area we are talking about.    It's already been approved by Congress to drill in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. There is more oil in the National Petroleum Reserve, in the reserves, than is in ANWR. That is a fact. It has been documented, and we are going to talk about that.    Now, the folks on the other side, who we listened to for the hour before us, we heard about how there is no oil in those 68 million acres, and those are dry wells. I think it's a pretty hard case to make that there is no oil in an area of Alaska that's called the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That's the area that we are talking about. So why aren't the oil companies drilling there?    In some cases the oil companies own the leases, but in some cases the Department of the Interior has dragged their feet in getting those leases out and having the auctions and the lease sales to get the process started.    We brought legislation to the floor to say to the oil companies, you use it or you lose it. You have 68 million acres on which there is 4.8 million barrels of oil per day every day in our own land and in our own territory that we can bring out, 4.8 million barrels that would almost double domestic production.    Those lands are already leased, and if you as a big oil company don't start producing on that land, or at least do some due diligence, we understand it takes time, takes 10 years before the first drop of oil comes. At least start the process, do the surveying, do the geological work. If you can't prove that you are doing that, we are going to give it to somebody who will, because we are for domestic production.    My good friend from Georgia (Mr. Gingrey) was on right before us. I take him at his word when he talks about how Republicans are for conservation, and Republicans understand the issues around this very complicated problem with our energy crisis and the environmental situation that the gentleman referred to. I take him at his word when he says Republicans are for that.    I would hope that he takes me at my word and takes us at our word when I say that Democrats support domestic drilling. Democrats have brought legislation to the floor to encourage domestic drilling. The only way we can drill here, drill now, is if we allow the oil companies, encourage the oil companies, to drill on land that's already permitted, leased and ready to go.    I yield to the gentleman from Connecticut. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. The gentleman talks about the lack of action in the previous Congresses. For 6 years, prior to this current session of Congress, the Republicans controlled the Congress, they controlled the White House, and they controlled the agenda, most importantly, of what legislation was brought to the floor, and what issues were talked about, and what the legislative priorities were of the Congress, and what did they do on their pet issue that they talk about right now?    Their top issue, every time they have one of these hours, they come down here and they talk about drill here, drill now. There is nothing more important we can do than drilling and opening up ANWR and opening up the Outer Continental Shelf.    So when they controlled the Congress and the White House for 6 years and controlled the agenda and could have done anything that they wanted, what were they able to do on drilling? How important did they think that it was?    Well, you may have noticed, I say to the gentleman, that they didn't open up ANWR, and they didn't open up the Outer Continental Shelf. For the most part, they didn't even talk that much about it because they didn't see it as a political wedge issue that they can use in an election year when everything is going against them, except for, they feel, this issue.        When they had the opportunity to deal with this, they didn't act. So it falls on deaf ears to this Member of Congress to have them continually come down here and criticize this Congress for a lack of action. When they controlled the agenda, they didn't deal with it. And more importantly, when we control the agenda, we're constantly bringing legislation to the floor  encouraging the oil companies to use the land that's already permitted and ready to go.    Withholding shipments to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which has led to the decrease in gas prices that we've seen over the last week to 10 days, that was an action of this Congress that led to that decrease. And many Members on the other side opposed that.    Well, we're bringing legislation to the floor dealing with a variety of issues, dealing with gas prices and energy independence, and they continually vote against it. Yet they have the audacity to come before us for a full hour right before and lecture us on our lack of activity on this issue. Mr. ALTMIRE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. I appreciate the gentleman from Connecticut.    And the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Meek) talked about the difference between the freedom that we all enjoy to say things on the floor and the responsibility that we have to quote facts, to use real numbers. And the people on the other side who come down here on occasion I would say are very good at the PR aspect of the job, at getting the message out and in trying to undermine the message that we put out.    We think about this drilling issue, we think about the Outer Continental Shelf, and we think about the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, ANWR, and we say, well, the numbers that they're using on the other side may not be as accurate as they could be. They might be overstating the situation a little bit, both with regard to the time necessary to get that oil, but more importantly, the amount of oil that's there at all. And the pushback that we get from the other side is often, oh, those are Democratic talking points, and they don't know what they're talking about, and we're not going to listen to them because they're Democrats and they're just reading talking points. So I wanted to read a quote from someone, and then I'm going to put the source of the quote up.    This is from a hearing that was held yesterday here on Capitol Hill, because we're working every day to try to figure out what we can do on a daily basis to bring the price of gasoline down in the short term and the long term. And a hearing was held, and one of the witnesses said this: ``They mislead the public''--talking about the big oil companies and the proponents of opening up ANWR and new areas of the Outer Continental Shelf is who this gentleman is referring to.    ``They mislead the public. And the public thinks, well, if we've got 86 billion barrels of oil sitting out there, why don't we just go drill it and produce it and lower the price of gasoline? We can lower it to $2 a gallon. That's the way it's been characterized, which I think is totally misleading. Experts are way off when they say there's 86 billion barrels of oil off the coast. That number is way overstated. They also talk about ANWR having 16 billion. I think the number there is a lot closer to 2 billion. That's all you can get out of there. I don't see any fuel that's going to replace gasoline and diesel except natural gas.''    Well, is that a Democratic talking point? That's basically what we've been saying for the last several months, but no, that was not a Democrat that said that, that was none other than an oilman, and certainly not someone historically who has been very complimentary of Democratic policies, Mr. T. Boone Pickens, somebody who understands the oil industry in this country. That's what he said. And I would ask my colleagues if they've seen the commercials that he's running on TV. And the slogan that he uses is, ``We can't drill our way out of this problem.'' And this is the quote that I read.    So we have validation from sources that understand the oil industry and understand that this is more than just a political hot button issue that we can use to score cheap political points. This is the biggest problem facing the country. And we have to come together as Republicans and Democrats and do everything we possibly can to work on short-term solutions and long-term solutions to solve this energy crisis.    And it's going to take all hands on deck. And the quicker that we move away from the cheap political points and trying to play one-upmanship on the rhetoric, the better chance we're going to have of solving this problem.    So I would yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Meek). Mr. ALTMIRE. (THIS CONGRESS HAS A RECORD TO BE PROUD OF IN SUPPORTING OUR TROOPS AND VETERANS -- (House of Representatives - July 10, 2008))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Madam Speaker, nobody can dispute that this Congress has a record to be proud of in support of our troops and our Nation's veterans. When we learned of the disgraceful treatment of our servicemen and women at Walter Reed, we took immediate action to provide the funding and oversight necessary to hire more case workers and improve the setting and treatment for our brave wounded warriors.    We acted quickly and decisively to provide the largest funding increase in the 78-year history of the VA, and we provided for increased screening and treatment of traumatic brain injury at every VA health care facility in this country.    We modernized and increased the benefits for the GI bill, and we provided additional loans and capital for small business owners who serve our Nation through the Guard and Reserve.    Madam Speaker, this Congress has a record to be proud of in supporting our troops and assisting our Nation's veterans. Mr. ALTMIRE. (OVERSIGHT FINALLY IN THE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - March 08, 2007))   Mr. ALTMIRE. Madam Speaker, with Democrats now in control of Congress, oversight is finally being conducted. The new Democratic Congress has already held 81 separate hearings on important issues involving the war in Iraq, including the billions of dollars that are unaccounted for. The documented pattern of neglect at Walter Reed goes back at least 3 years, yet previous Congresses did nothing. But just this week the new Congress held four separate hearings on the treatment of our wounded soldiers.    Also, this week the House held hearings on the firing of seven U.S. attorneys for purely political reasons. Partisanship and politics have no place in our justice system, and this House is going to aggressively investigate this situation.    Madam Speaker, this level of oversight is part of the Democrats' effort to bring real change to Washington. Two months into the new Congress, we are already delivering on that promise. \""
